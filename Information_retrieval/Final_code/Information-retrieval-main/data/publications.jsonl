The objective is to improve off-site precast production operations using multi-layered genetic algorithms (GAs). The multi-layered concept emerged in response to the requirement of modelling different sets of labour inputs. As part of the techniques used in developing a crew allocation ‘SIM_Crew’ system, a process mapping methodology is used to model processes of precast concrete operations and to provide the framework and input required for simulation. Process simulation is then used to model and imitate all production processes and GAs are embedded within the simulation model to provide a rapid and intelligent search. A multi-layered chromosome is used to store different sets of inputs such as crews working on different shifts and process priorities. The results illustrate that adopting different combinations of crews of workers has a substantial impact on the labour allocation cost and this should lead to increased efficiency and lower production cost.

Briefly, overbooking lets airlines to mitigate the risk of flying with empty seats. However, identifying an overbooking level is a complicated task due to the uncertainties associated with the external factors that affect the booking process fundamentally. There have been many methods proposed for overbooking problem on a single-leg flight, yet few studies have been conducted on airline networks. Although, overbooking problem can be handled at the single-leg level in practice, considering the problem as a network revenue management problem can be more profitable for the airlines due to the fact that seat allocation in one leg affects other legs in the network. In this paper, a fuzzy linear programming model is proposed for the overbooking optimisation problem in multi-leg flights with multiple fare-classes. Unlike the majority of the previous studies, the uncertainties related to demand are addressed by defining the demand as fuzzy numbers. Our main aim is to propose an optimisation method that maximises the overall revenue of the flight network by minimising the number of empty seats and the number of denied passengers. Moreover, we strive to show that the proposed model can be used as a decision support tool by the airline revenue management analysts or the decision makers to assist the process of determining booking limits for different flights in airline networks. We expect to test the proposed method for different scenarios and upon successful completion of this research we will investigate the advantages of using fuzzy theory in airline network overbooking problem.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The major contribution to Flight fatalities is related to LOC-I situations when pilots are unable to handle control of an aircraft during an onset of aerodynamic stall at high angles of attack provoking almost unrecoverable Flight conditions. The second contributor to critical flight accidents is related to RE situations during landing and take-o phases of flight. It is now generally accepted that the reduction in accidents can be achieved via improved training of line pilots using modern flight simulators, which are now used for regular pilot training in normal flight conditions. Pilot training in extended flight envelope will soon become mandatory following new regulations from FAA, ICAA and EASA. Training of pilots for upset prevention and recovery in LOC-I critical conditions need flight simulators upgraded with aerodynamic models covering extended flight envelope including high angles of attack with separated low conditions. Flight accidents with RE require improved modeling of aerodynamics in close proximity to the ground considering cross-wind conditions. Data for aerodynamic models for normal and extended flight conditions are traditionally obtained from wind tunnel tests using different methods such as static, forced oscillation and rotary balance tests. The role of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods in generating aerodynamic data for extended flight envelope has a significant potential in improving delity of aerodynamics models and reducing the cost of such models. Wind tunnel test results at high angles of attack are sensitive to the level of low turbulence in the tunnel and aero-elastic vibrations of the aircraft model, while computational simulation predictions are highly sensitive to the selection of turbulence model closing the Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Naiver-Stokes (URANS) equations. This Thesis is mostly focused on computational prediction of static stall hysteresis, ground effect and ice accretion effect on aerodynamics of flight which leads to upset of aircraft in the extended flight envelope. The ultimate motive is to generate reliable aerodynamic data which can be used to develop flight models that can be used to train pilots for loss of control of aircraft in critical flight situations", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The trend in television news as a source of information gathering is definitely downward overall. Television news is the second most popular medium for sourcing news in South Africa (Malila 2013:5), and although television technology may be on its way out of our lives to be replaced by hard-drives, laptops, tablets, and digital media, news on this medium is still a universal common denominator in finding information. Television news still has the broadest reach, second only to radio especially in South Africa. Just this statistic tells us that this medium is worth study, but even more so is the impact television has on the world. Television is a difficult and complex, yet rewarding, medium to analyse. As Ruth Teer-Tomaselli (2012) noted on my Master’s degree, “it is image, sound, and verbal text. These vectors slide across the analytical plate like peas eaten with chopsticks”. The texts located within television news include the audio track (dialogue, sound) and the visual track (images, as well as the political economy context of media ownership, and these three tracks contain separate meanings as well as a combination meaning when placed together. The juxtaposition between these different layers provides syntagmatic and paradigmatic meanings that can be awkward to decipher without a dedicated methodology. Teer-Tomaselli points out that  “the how to do it part is so crucial” (2012) when studying television news. While several researchers have attempted a systematic analysis using semiotic, discourse, and content analysis (Chandler 1994a, Berger 2010, and Dueck 1995 for example), investigation is awkward and lengthy without a specific methodological approach. Taking into account the image and narrative analysis akin to film studies, as well as discourse analysis as per print analysis, this paper argues for a dedicated methodological approach for television news analysis, a popular yet awkward medium to analyse. The precise methodology for best practice qualitative text analysis is yet poorly defined (Macnamara 2005:16), but this paper, passed on my own Master’s degree and current PhD research, provides a suggestion to that very concern. No qualitative content or narrative analysis can ever be as precise as quantitative, scientistic research, but I argue here for a simplified beginner analysis, or a “best practice” method to open the field for future research scholars and media students.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The paper starts from the working principles of the air motor and modeling approach. Then the mechanical geometry structure of air motors is analyzed in order to derive a generic mathematical description of the air motor. A complete dynamic process of the air motor system is derived based on the mechanical structure, orifice and other physics theory. The simulation results are presented with a typical set of air motor parameters. Due to the nature of the motor structure, the chamber volume changes are discontinuous which leads to discontinuous chamber pressure variations. The characteristics of the discontinuity present difficulties for applying advanced control theory to air motor control. Therefore, further approximations are carried out and the comparison of dynamic responses between the original model and the approximated model indicated that the approximation is accurate enough to be acceptable for control strategy development.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The suppliers are selected considering three objectives including minimization of the total cost and risk and maximization of the strategic plan achievement. Two decision variables are introduced to handle risky suppliers - safety time for suppliers with consistent delivery problems and safety stock for critical products supplied by suppliers with a high non-conformance rate. The risk is modelled using two parameters: the product risk (related to the product complexity and the authority of the relevant supplier) and the supplier risk (related to the quality and delivery performance indicators). The achievement of the strategic plan considers categorisation of the suppliers into four categories: E-exit suppliers with bad scores, Mmaintain suppliers with good scores difficult to replace, G-grow suppliers with increasing importance and N-new strategically important suppliers. Uncertain contributions of the four supplier categories to the achievement of the strategic plan are described by imprecise terms such as low, medium, high or very high and are modelled using fuzzy numbers. Depending on user preferences, each objective can be assigned different importance. The fuzzy multi-objective optimisation model is transformed into a corresponding crisp optimisation model with a single objective to maximise satisfaction degree of attaining the optimal value of each objective.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

A network is fundamentally a set of items, which we call vertices or nodes, with connections between them, called edges. An informative network model must account for the complexities of emergent biological behavior while still being simple enough to allow reasonable interpretation of the results. Recent years have witnessed a substantial new movement in biological network research, with the focus shifting away from the analysis of single small networks and the properties of individual nodes or edges within such networks toward the consideration of statistical properties of large-scale networks. This change of scale has also forced a corresponding change in our analytical approaches. The outline of this chapter is as follows. In Section 4.1, we describe empirical studies of biological networks. In Section 4.2, we describe some of the common properties important for the understanding of the functioning of networked systems. In Section 4.3, we provide a survey of module discovery approaches. In Section 4.4, we address different issues related to the task of network inference. In Section 4.5, we summarize metrics for quantification of the performance of network inference methods.

High product variety along with faster new product introduction may result in an inefficiency in production. In order to be responsive to the market requirements, maximising the production rate is essential. At one of the vehicle manufacturers in the UK, the current sub-assembly process of tailgates, where tailgates are lifted by carriers, assembled then fed to the main assembly line to be fitted to their matched vehicles, is facing problem of occasional starvations of empty carriers when they return from the fitting point. This problem flags a concern of stopping the main line and as a consequence, slowing down the production. In order to solve this problem, a flow diagram is developed to represent the logic of the process. Discrete-event simulation approach is used to mimic operations of the sub-assembly line. A simulation model is then developed to identify the bottleneck(s), determine whether or not additional carriers are required and design scenarios for improving the process, taking into consideration random failures in the main line. The results show that starvations are caused due to the main line failures, which lead to high buffer levels of carriers lifting tailgates within the sub-assembly process. This leads to less empty carriers remaining for a new assembly cycle. A slight improvement of 1.2% in production speed could be achieved by reducing the bottleneck time by 15 seconds and less than 1% improvement if five more carriers are added.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

One of the base rules is the first come, first served. This rule will not allow orders to be processed by any of the processing stations until the previous order leaves the shared process i.e. if resources are shared then the order will wait until the resource switches to idle state. The manufacturing shop floor is responsible of manufacturing raw material and transforming them into final products that will meet the customer requirements including a delivery deadline to the customer. Late delivery of orders because of low productivity, high production times and pessimal resources allocation at shop floors will lead to lower levels of customers’ satisfaction. Hence, more advanced ways to process orders are required to improve shop floors performance. The main aim of the project is to design and develop a capacity simulator model based on spreadsheet tools. This model will enable parallel processing of orders when simulating shop floors and it is based on discrete event simulation methodology. The key objective is to model the logic of shop floor operations and the logic parallel simulation; mimicking real life shop floor operations which will help towards creating the capacity calculator simulator. Flowchart will be used to model logical operations on shop floors as well as the logic of the parallel simulation algorithm. In addition, UML diagrams representing entities, data and attributes in the shop floor will be used. The developed simulation is established via spreadsheet tools with scripted VBA Macro codes. Verification and validation techniques have been applied through results analysis of tested case study scenarios, which will provide the justification of the developed model. The expected outputs will show a reduction in the total production, queue times and increment in resource utilisations of the shop floor being investigated. The status of whether or not orders have been produced on time will be displayed.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Despite being traditionally stick to best practices established by MECRs in respect to the strategic trade, Russia has kept a slight room for maneuver when it comes to define sensitive items from a national point of view. Moreover, its ambiguous relationship with the Australia Group (a MECR dealing specifically with chemical weapons) is reflected in a sometimes fluffy implementation of the regime’s peculiar control lists. The subjective profile is approached from a geopolitical perspective, as it is ultimately twisted with the legitimacy of the intended end-user of the sensitive item to be traded.

Actual volumetric efficiencies of the evaluated system lay below the characteristic figures of reciprocating pumps. In addition to the previously described, clear volumetric displacement capacity sensitivity was encountered when pressure fluctuations in the system does not exceed 50 psi. The steady-state simulation of future scenarios that include production growth, suggest that the pressure range within the pipeline system will exceed both the maximum discharge pressure of the pumping system and the allowable stresses of the piping network in place. Further network topology evaluation lead to the identification of activity hubs and flow bottlenecks; flow restrictions were analyzed to be reversed by increasing the flowing area in the main network branch.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

These are used to design pipeline systems. Moreover, simulations allow evaluation of existing pipeline systems to identify bottleneck that could affect production handling and transport due to capacity limitations of surface facilities or changing process variables (GOR, properties of fluids, water cut, etc). Thermo-hydraulic simulations require the use of suitable mathematical models to reduce prediction uncertainty leading to improve and optimize pipeline systems design and operation contributing to reduce both CAPEX and OPEX. In this sense, some authors have estimated that investment costs related to a proper pipeline sizing could account for over 25% of the total project cost for onshore facilities. Given this economic impact, engineers must make efforts to develop a rigorous simulation model considering the best practices for their field. Thermo-hydraulic studies of pipeline systems located in the Faja using simulations are challenging due to multiphase flow conditions, high liquid viscosities, hilly-terrain and ambient temperature changes that generate high pressure drop and slug flow, as well as pressure and flow rate fluctuations. These conditions imply that the simulation model requires technical knowledge together with experience associated to the interest oil field. Both requirements help to the simulation engineers to implement lessons learned to predict the hydraulic behavior much better leading to define strategies to improve design and operation of pipeline systems. About this an overview of lessons learned for Faja field is presented in this work. These lessons learned consider recommendations aiming to reduce uncertainty in predicting heavy oil properties, pressure drop, temperature, flow pattern and liquid holdup that lead to optimize production process, invest and operational costs. These advices are a guide to simulation engineers in order to develop more rigorous simulation models to estimate pipeline hydraulic behavior as close to reality", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

In particular, the paper explores to what extent institutional antecedents, the entrepreneurs’ social networks and inter-organizational networks determined the decisions to internationalize made by the firms. We adopt a framework of analysis based on ‘pull’ and ‘push’ factors to analyse the influence of networks and institutions on the outcome. Case study methodology was adopted to examine ten Brazilian start-up technological companies. A typology of networks was established and its impact on the internationalisation decisions was assessed. The influence of institutional determinants and entrepreneurial characteristics were controlled by selecting start-ups that are spin-offs of one university. Our findings suggest that social and inter-organisational networks have played a central role on the firms’ decisions to internationalise to the extent that they helped to identify opportunities in foreign markets. In the cases in which ‘pull’ factors such as customer demand prevail, the typology of networks was predominantly Knowledge and Tactical. On the other hand in the cases in which ‘push’ factors such as entrepreneurs’ networks, cognisance and familiarity with the foreign market acted as a catalyst to internationalise, the typology of networks was mostly of the Knowledge and Strategic types. This study contributes to the theories on international business in the context of emerging economies, adopting a multidisciplinary perspective that captures the interplay of institutions, organizational and social networks. Second, it contributes to the literature in the field of international entrepreneurship by exploring how different ‘pull’ and ‘push’ factors influence the firms’ strategy towards internationalisation, specifically incorporating the impact of the entrepreneurs’ knowledge, social and organisational ties.

The emissions were 32.2% lower than the 1990 base year value. However, the residential sector which contributed about 13% of UK’s 2015 greenhouse gas emission saw a 4% increase in emission within the same period. In addition, energy use between identical homes have been found to differ significantly; such variations in energy use can only be justified by the fact that energy consumption remains invisible to householders. Poor energy use has also been observed to drive many homes into fuel poverty. Research has shown that clearer cues are required to relate household lifestyle choices and daily activities to energy consumption. Space heating, cooking, washing, bathing and many other activities performed quite often in the homes are environmentally significant but appear discreet to everyday consciousness. These activities and the generation of the energy that power them are carbon-intensive and contributes to the greenhouse gas proportion in the atmosphere. These activities if poorly managed also produce indoor environment conditions that are detrimental to the health of householders. This research uses data capturing and visualisation tools to provide householders with sufficient information to make the right choices about their energy use. Discreet real-time metering and sensor systems are introduced to homes and used to capture energy use while dashboards are used to make these details visible to the occupants. In addition, the dashboard provides optimisation tips to help the householders make better decisions.

However, the single actuators in the current switch technology mean that a single actuator fault will result in the failure of the switch (and the concomitant delays to trains waiting to pass the switch). This paper focuses on providing redundant actuation through an approach known as High Redundancy Actuation (HRA), which might allow track switches to remain operational after failure in actuator elements. The paper also proposes the use of closed-loop control (track switches are usually operated open-loop). In the paper, we introduce a model of a C-type switch and validate it against results from a previous paper. This model is then used combined with an HRA of nine elements (3x3). Two closed-loop controllers are then proposed for each of the single actuator and the HRA actuator system. The findings indicate that closed-loop control on its own has some benefits. However, when combined with HRA, the resulting system is able to tolerate a number of faults in the actuator subsystems, creating an effective graceful degradation rather than the sudden failure with a traditional single actuator.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Assessing surgical performance and efficiency, identifying skilled tool use and choreography, and planning operational and logistical aspects of OR resources are just a few of the applications that could benefit. Unfortunately, obtaining the annotations needed to train machine learning models to identify and localize surgical tools is a difficult task. Annotating bounding boxes frame-byframe is tedious and time-consuming, yet large amounts of data with a wide variety of surgical tools and surgeries must be captured for robust training. Moreover, ongoing annotator training is needed to stay up to date with surgical instrument innovation. In robotic-assisted surgery, however, potentially informative data like timestamps of instrument installation and removal can be programmatically harvested. The ability to rely on tool installation data alone would significantly reduce the workload to train robust tool-tracking models. With this motivation in mind we invited the surgical data science community to participate in the challenge, SurgToolLoc 2022.

Also the time for gas concentration distribution tending to become shorter for steady state and gas density gradient on vertical elastic becomes smaller. In the condition when the door is half opened, it takes 25 minutes to reach a stable maximum concentration at the central point of the kitchen and the spaces above 0.8m in the kitchen are full of explosive gas. It has been found that the lower location of leaking source led to the larger flammable zone. Window ventilation can reduce the gas cumulating in the kitchen significantly. When the window is opened to 0.03 m2 areas, and the speed of inlet ventilation reaches to 2 m/s, there is almost no flammable zone in the kitchen.

The evolution of space applications is putting increasingly stringent requirements on satellite attitude control performance, thence the increasing importance of attitude control hardware.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

This is a controversial debate that has implications for peace and conflict, as the debate relates to policies regarding weapons and the potential prevention of mass shootings. However, there has been a lack of detailed analysis of the ways in which the arguments in this debate are made. As the discursive approach can overcome these limitations, it is used to analyse texts produced by two key players in this debate, (then) President Barack Obama in support of tighter controls and Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association (NRA) against. The results demonstrate two polarised dichotomies. The first of these sees both speakers present themselves as working to protect something important. Obama presents his measures as in the service of protecting lives where LaPierre presents his opposition to the same measures as designed to protect freedom. A second dichotomy can be seen where Obama constructs those who support gun control as ‘courageous’, whereas for LaPierre these same people are constructed as villains. The analysis is used to identify the ways in which both speakers attempt to present their arguments as legitimate. It is therefore shown how discursive psychology, when applied to the gun control debate, helps us understand how issues of peace and conflict are drawn upon and how such debates can influence policy regarding the continuation of armed violence.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Electric vehicles with electrified chassis systems e.g. brakes, steering have an increased safety potential because of the reduced response time and the ability to apply continuous control. The main subject of the present paper is the development of an integrated chassis control scheme using all feasible actuators such as steering, braking in an optimal coordination towards regulating the vehicle dynamics. During critical driving situations, in which some of the tires reach their limits, the vehicle dynamics are nonlinear and complex. The State Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) technique is a reconfigurable nonlinear optimal controller. In SDRE the nonlinear dynamics of the system is factorized into the state vector and the product of a matrix valued function that depends on the state itself. In doing so, the nonlinearities of the system are fully captured bringing the nonlinear system to a linear like structure having state-dependent coefficient (SDC) matrices. The nonlinear regulator is derived by minimizing an objective function which is formulated as a weighted integral of the system response and the actuators effort. The proposed optimized integrated control is based on a 3 DOF vehicle model with a nonlinear combined slip Pacejka tire model and the SDRE technique. An extended linearization scheme of the system’s state space equations on the basis of the Pacejka tire model is developed and a suboptimal controller is computed at each time increment by solving efficiently an Algebraic Riccati Equation. The proposed control strategy has been evaluated experimentally by implementing the control system on a real time dSpace platform on a prototype vehicle. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed IVDC in stabilizing the vehicle during limit handling manoeuvres. A limitation of the current study is using the limited fault diagnosis and fault tolerant module. For the first time the application of SDRE using different vehicle actuators is presented and proven to be effective. Furthermore, the benefit of the proposed approach for obstacle avoidance maneuvers is shown through comparison with other methods found in the literature. The problem of designing an optimal integrated chassis control system based on the SDRE technique has been presented. The proposed system has been tested experimentally and has been proven capable to stabilize the vehicle with an optimized tire force distribution.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

LoC – which effectively the stall/spin event, has consistently appeared in accident statistics over this period, but at very different rates for different aircraft types. This raises two important questions - why do these LoC events happen and why is there a difference between aircraft types?.\n \n The biggest discrepancy affects the Cessna 150 and Cessna 152, two aircraft similar in appearance and highly popular in the pilot training environment. The Cessna 150 falls approximately on the average for stall/spin related fatal accidents in the UK GA fleet, whereas the Cessna 152 exhibits an extremely low accident rate. Brunel Flight Safety Laboratory, in conjunction with the UK General Aviation Safety Council, undertook to try and understand why.\n \n The key design differences affecting performance and handling qualities were thoroughly researched using available published material and informal interviews with type-experienced students, pilots and flying instructors.\n \n A comprehensive flight test programme was then commenced using examples of both aircraft types to gather additional research data in order to assess and compare the apparent performance and handling qualities (both qualitatively and quantitatively). The flight tests were performed at different CG conditions relevant to the key design differences, concentrating upon apparent longitudinal (static and dynamic) stability and control characteristics, stalling and low-speed handling characteristics, and cockpit ergonomics / pilot workload.\n \n This test was using normal flying club aircraft, but in most cases with a 2-man (TP+FTE) crew with data recorded both manually and using a low-cost, portable Appareo GAU1000A Flight Data Recorder (FDR). \n \n The paper covers both the conduct of these tests – flight testing within a university environment, preparation, pre and post-test analysis, construction of Cooper-Harper tasks and the use of low-cost automated flight data recording. It will also however discuss the team’s initial conclusions and ongoing research into both design and pilot training causes behind GA LoC incidents.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The manual control system for independent motion control of an aircraft on rolling and sideslip angles is given in (Guskov and Zagainov, 1980). The system depends upon a real-time measurement of air-dynamic coefficients of the aircraft, or requires the information from the tabulated parameters on all regimes of the aircraft motion. However, methods of precise measurement of air-dynamic coefficients in non-stationary conditions of the aircraft motion are not yet available at the present time. The exact parameters for all regimes of the aircraft motion cannot be obtained from a-priory measurements either. Therefore, a complete decoupled motion of an aircraft cannot be achieved. In this paper the solution for a decoupled motion of an aircraft is obtained in the class of non-searching adaptive control systems with a reference model (Petrov et. al, 1980). The new algorithms developed in this paper achieve a decoupled motion with desirable dynamic precision even in the conditions of high non-stationary of parameters. The robustness of the control system to the interaction of subsystems is accomplished as well.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Immigration control, broadly defined, includes regulatory activities aimed at managing the in-flow of aliens, undertaken outside states’ territories, at ports of entry, and within states’ territories. These include the  the processing of visa applications, the holding and processing of refugees, and the detention and deportation of aliens in general. In developed states, immigration control activates undertaken both inside and outside a state’s territory are increasingly being transferred to private companies. Medium and large multinational companies – some with employee sizes as large as 600,000 and portfolios in 10’s of billions of USD – are taking over immigration control activities. These private actors occupy a bizarre space at the crossroads of privatization, which necessitates the conversion of the field from a governmental domain into a service industry, and securitization, which is underpinned by a sense of public power. Gross human rights violations, ramshackle service, and cries of accountability are constant features of this industry.  The ‘customers’ of this service industry being, in reality, people from developing states, immigration control is a spectacular venue where the new forces of privatization and securitization are seen guarding the old frontiers of global North-South power relations.

After mixing atoms A and B, the volumes of A and B in the alloy will differ from the original volumes in the pure constituents which is formulated by means of the Miedema model and is called enthalpy of formation. Concept of heats of solution at infinite dilution of metal A into metal B is considered for calculation of solution enthalpy. Entropy of fusion of metals are used for modeling the transformation energies for semi-conducting and gaseous elements.

However, the nature of M2M traffic is different as terminals usually have to transmit small amounts of data infrequently. In this paper, we evaluate an LTE-A Relay Node (RN) based solution to integrate M2M devices into mobile cellular networks. We develop an M2M scenario consisting of both e-healthcare and logistic devices along with normal LTE-A users in our simulation model using OPNET modeler. The simulation results indicate the better performance of LTE-A network if RN is used for the multiplexing and aggregation of M2M data traffic.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The objective of this research is to reduce the computational burden by developing a reduced order model that meets the accuracy requirements for such a performance evaluation. A model reduction technique, based on “Proper Orthogonal Decomposition”, has been applied using only the results of a commercial Finite Element model for a bonnet of a production car.

Stream-flow series of the annual maximum, annual minimum and annual mean in Ahvaz hydrometric station as representative of the watershed have been considered. In order to determine the change points, we use the Pettitt test while the trend in the annual stream-flow series of this station is evaluated by the Mann-Kendall test. However, the Pettitt test cannot detect any change point in these series, but the Mann-Kendall test shows that there is an increasing trend. This increasing trend has no fitness with observed data in recent decade. Therefore, the potential change points were determined and consequently, these series converted to two sub-series based on the results obtained from the Pettitt test, wide variation from human activities and variation of hydro climatic conditions. We then applied the Mann-Kendall test in these two sub-series which showed significant decreasing trend in both of them. From this method, it can be concluded that the averages of the second sub-series are larger than the first one in the three annual stream-flow series. This increasing ratio is equal to 1.34, 1.16 and 1.2 for stream-flow series of annual maximum, annual minimum and annual mean respectively. These changes are similar to changes in annual rainfall time series. We can say that the sudden increase of precipitation in recent decades makes the averages of the second sub-series larger. Results showed that inspite of wide range human induced changes, stream-flow series is more affected from the watershed rainfall time series variations. In addition, significant decreasing trend in the two sub-series can be due to the following causes: the growth of population, temperature rise, construction of three dams on the Karun River, implementing the different projects for developing agricultural, and conservation from soil and water resources.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Targeting a population of lifestyle entrepreneurs (n=101) within the surf industry and subculture of Devon and Cornwall, UK, this study utilised an online survey to collect both qualitative and quantitative data. Analysis involved IBM SPSS Statistics for quantitative data, whilst qualitative data was analysed using a combination of latent and inductive content analysis. Results found that 82.2% of the Lifestyle Entrepreneur population surveyed were Freestylers who viewed life quality, lifestyle, profit and growth of great value. Freestyler’s were found to be male, aged between 25-34 with a broad range of educational achievement, but the majority being university graduates. Although Freestylers value lifestyle during the start-up phase of their business, they focus on the future economic challenges that they may face. Similarly, although they value the location of their business for its lifestyle benefits, it is not overly valued as a location for their business. This illustrates the competing motives of the Freestyler which sees them constantly trying to balance their value for lifestyle and business. This study goes on to suggest that the interpretive framework (Deacon and Firebaugh, 1988; Morris, 1998) proposes that these competing motives can be managed by the Freestyler through an ongoing process of input, throughput, output and feedback.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The application of low power laser scanning techniques to automated assembly and tool condition monitoring tasks has been investigated with the aim of developing effective tool and process management systems integrated with the manufacturing process. As well as being more cost effective and reliable than human inspectors, automated inspection systems provide the technical feasibility and level of sophistication required for completely unattended operation for extended periods of time. The laser scanning technique compares favourably with CCD vision systems. It has proved to be more suitable for higher component feed rates and requires considerably less signal processing power. It also has the advantage of being less susceptible to changes in ambient lighting conditions. The current paper describes the development and application of laser scanners to automated assembly and to the inspection of tools for metal cutting. Both applications demonstrate the potential for such systems to provide a more reliable and cost effective alternative to human inspectors.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

In line with our hypotheses, we found that those SMEs that took a balanced approach were more likely to perceive benefits of implemented innovations than those that used only a financial approach to measurement. The perception of benefits then had a subsequent effect on overall attitudes towards innovation.

The project is part of my wider research regard- ing compositional techniques to elicit altered states of con- sciousness (ASCs). For the purposes of this article, ‘altered states of consciousness’ refers contextually to enhancing audio and graphical parameters of a video game in such a way as to re ect perceptual features of dreamlike, intoxi- cated or hallucinogenic experiences. The goal is to add a new level of interaction to existing video games and virtual worlds, by facilitating digital hallucinations and simulated temporal shifts of consciousness.The conceived ideal realisation of this project was to construct a ‘Universal Game Remix Device’ that would be suitable for use with many different video games, as a way to ‘remix’3 the virtual experiences towards altered consciousness aesthetics. Technical limitations regarding the feasibility of creating a Universal Game Remix Device led to the development of Quake Delirium, a Max/MSP4 patch5 which works only with the game Quake while running the Fitzquake6 modi cation. Quake Delirium can be considered as a video game ‘hack’7 which demon- strates the proof of concept.In the course of this article I shall demonstrate how altered states of consciousness can be portrayed in video games, either in unique cases or across multiple games by creat- ing the hypothesised Universal Game Remix Device. More broadly, through this discussion I hope to stimulate thought on ways in which interactive artworks and video games could be remixed, and how the potential for projects of this kind could be furthered substantially by the development of a new software protocol which allows artists using Max/MSP/Jitter8 and Pure Data9 to exchange video game information data and signals.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The challenge to the training community is to ensure that training environments are correctly specified so that effective training environment options can be selected. Whilst the principles of Needs Analysis/Front End Analysis have a well established tradition within NATO Forces, the underpinning analytical techniques are predominantly focused on individual training. In the published literature there are relatively few techniques that address the issues of team and collective training. The first part of the paper describes the architecture of the TCTNA method and its underpinning model of team training.

Automatization of measurement process with high speed and accuracy using non-contact scanners can give significant benefit for industry and for customers. The problem of digital surface reconstruction and surface measurement is especially important in medicine: for facial surgery simulation, diagnosis of craniofacial anomalies, trauma to the head, and for reconstructive surgery. Different approaches and equipment have been developed for the solution of this problem; for example, the photogrammetric method based on the principle of rasterstereography [1], a moiré - based light projection system [2], and the 3D reconstruction system [3]. All these methods are based on non-contact measurement principles. The surface digitization system based on a contact method is presented in [4]. The systems described above have many unresolved problems, (such, for example, as a time consuming analysis of the pattern of the object in order to obtain its digital image [1]; a lengthy calibration procedure and intensive computation (off-line processing of data) [2]; huge size and weight, high cost of the system [3]; slow data acquisition and restricted accuracy due to friction of a probe with a surface [4]).

Phoneme awareness is an important predictor of growth in reading skills, but few studies have examined whether the relationship is truly reciprocal, despite frequent statements in the literature that this is the case. Method. We explored this question using a longitudinal design that measured letter-knowledge, decoding skills (nonword and regular word reading) and phoneme awareness (isolation and deletion of phonemes in nonwords) during the first two years of school. Seven hundred and seven children were tested at school entry (T1), then again at the end of the first year (T2) and again at the end of the second year (T3). Results. Phoneme awareness predicted letter-knowledge, and letter-knowledge predicted phoneme awareness from T1-T2, indicating an early reciprocal relationship. However, while phoneme awareness predicted decoding, decoding did not predict phoneme awareness from T2-T3, implying that the relationship became uni-directional once children began to read. We will present additional analyses to elucidate the mechanisms behind the initial reciprocity, including a test of the orthographic influence hypothesis. Conclusions. Our results highlight the role of letter learning in precipitating awareness of phonemes and suggest that phoneme awareness is a distinct process that, once precipitated, is not influenced by reading skill.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The world’s population is growing faster than ever before, and there is now, in too many cities, all over the world, a shortage of land and budgets for building good quality, and the necessary affordable housing for all. Therefore, architects, designers and planners are even more scrutinised and results are expected to be high, at all costs and at all levels. Furthermore, housing has to be appropriate for the location, type of people, families and generations that require housing, for many years to come. Moreover, let’s not forget the rising cost of housing; for all involved; the developer, designer, architect, landowner, local authority or private owners or social tenants. Therefore an innovative, sustainable approach is a must, as we see, in different ways; in the projects featured in this essay.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

To achieve this, social role theory and role congruity theory were considered to explore how men and women view themselves in the workplace. Design/methodology/approach – Semi-structured in-depth face to face interviews were conducted with 24 participants who are professionals in 8 Nigerian banks in order to get an in-depth understanding of the phenomenon under investigation. The research employed a qualitative research approach founded on grounded theory. The research was conducted with employees of commercial banks in Nasawara state and Abuja which is the Federal Capital territory of Nigeria. Findings – The results indicate that corporate prostitution is a significant issue in the Nigerian banking sector. The other issues that emerged from this study are that women are not only stuck at low level jobs but face disparate treatment in terms of unrealistic targets, responsibility and status quo. Research limitations/implications – This is an empirical study and contributes to the theory by providing new perspective on the study of gender roles as the participants share their voices and experiences working in Nigerian banks. This study only considered few banks operating in two states in the Nigerian banking sector and therefore future research activities should consider other banks in other states and also other sectors in Nigeria and determine any potential boundaries of this findings. Practical implications – The study reveals several significant issues of gender disparate treatment in the workplace thereby helping the HR practitioners and policy makers to review their policies to promote gender equality in the workplace. The change in policies in the work setting would also bring in change in the social perception. Originality/value – This study moves away from the polarised conceptualisation of gender between extremes of biological essentialism and social constructivism and instead explored a more nuanced conceptualisation of the term in order to provide a deeper understanding of the theories of gender and their socio-cultural implications on human relationships across various contexts. The study also provides a framework based on its findings for further research.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Method: 27 children with dyslexia and 29 children with a history of otitis media (repeated ear infections causing fluctuating hearing levels), in addition to pairwise reading-age and chronological-age matched typically developing children, completed a battery of measures. Morphological awareness was measured through oral phonological and morphological awareness tasks. Phonological and morphological processing skills were examined in reading and spelling tasks. Results: Children with dyslexia performed below chronological age and at or below reading level on all measures of phonological and morphological awareness and processing. In contrast, children with OME had difficulties with particular aspects of phonological processing but showed age appropriate use of morphology. Conclusions: Difficulties with phonology don’t necessarily lead to difficulties in morphological awareness or processing. Hence, morphological skill can be independent from phonological skill. However, in dyslexia phonological and morphological skills are impaired, both in awareness and processing.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Transition metal sulfides possess multiple oxidation states that enable rich redox reactions for pseudocapacitance, which have been investigated as promising electrode materials for high performance supercapacitors. Here, NiMoS4 is successfully synthesized by a facile chemical co-precipitation method and further heating in Ar atmosphere. The as-prepared NiMoS4 is firstly studied in a three-electrode system, it exhibits a specific capacitance of 707 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor is fabricated using the NiMoS4 electrode as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode. The asymmetric supercapacitor demonstrates high rate capability and good cycling stability. The operation voltage could expand to 1.6 V, at which the energy density can reach 35 Wh kg-1 with a power density at 400 W kg-1. The capacitance maintains around 82.4% after 10000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g-1.

In this present invention a method to design a novel horizontal axis tidal turbine (HATT) blade shape through bio-mimicking a curved caudal fin shape to produce improved power coefficient is presented. At first, a parametric HATT is modelled according to the literature, where a centreline is then inserted which also acts as the master and a novel third order polynomial function was integrated on the centreline to model the Blue Marlin fish caudal fin look-alike target shape HATT. Secondly, a design strategy to move the curved blade backwards to the straight blade was also developed. Thirdly a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis is conducted to test the overall power efficiency of the caudal fin shaped blade with the standard HATT models in the literature. Finally, after comparing the improved efficiency of the bio-mimicked curved blade with the standard HATT models in the literature, it can be proved that bio-mimicking the caudal fin look-alike blade produces a higher power coefficient than the standard HATT blade.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

A review of previous accidents and a failure modes analysis showed no clear patterns of failure in helicopter transmissions and rotors. As a result, the accident to G-REDL was considered as the key case study to address, not least because the main rotor gearbox represents possibly the most challenging environment in which to achieve condition monitoring. A review of existing condition monitoring techniques across aviation and other industries has shown that there are a number of promising approaches available including fibre-optic strain sensors, torque rate sensors and others. However, when considering the specific case of real-time monitoring of rotating components inside a main rotor gearbox, the range of available technologies, which have been shown to be effective, is limited. Lab-scale testing on a ‘single planet’ type configuration showed that close monitoring allowed outer race bearing damage to be detected, with AE showing a detection advantage over vibration in that configuration. The analysis of these results used adaptive filters, enveloping and spectral kurtosis to extract defect frequencies from the signals, a more advanced technique than is typically used in existing HUMS systems. In order to support the use of AE inside the gearbox, an analogue, nearfield, wireless transmission system was developed capable of operating in that extremely challenging environment. The system is able to transmit a signal from the sensor with sufficient bandwidth to allow AE analysis to take place, and enough power to condition the signal and run the associated electronics. The phase response is virtually linear, meaning that time signals are correctly represented. A broadband sensor was identified which was able to operate at both typical AE and typical vibration frequencies, and which was able to withstand the temperature and oil present within the gearbox. The sensor is small and frangible and presents little risk to the gearbox were it to be released into the gears. The wireless system and the sensor were fitted to the planet gear of an operational gearbox and tested at operational speeds, temperatures and loads. Damage was introduced into the planets gear bearing outer races, in the form of cut-out sections of two different lengths. Analysis of the system output showed an apparent saturation of the sensor, possibly due to the high energy levels at the gear mesh frequency of the epicyclic stage, which cause periods of null response from the system. Despite this saturation, analysis of the signals for the two damage conditions, at three power settings, showed that for all power settings the outer race defect frequencies were clearly visible in the enveloped spectrum when compared with the no damage case. The research programme has shown that in-situ condition monitoring for helicopter main rotor gearboxes is feasible and that it is able to offer detection of incipient damage when traditional external vibration measurements cannot.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The results provide reliability and validity evidence in support of the seven-dimension scale. In addition, the structural testing of the scale highlights differences between tribal fans and their teams (relative to other teams) in terms of five behavioral intentions and two commitment- related outcome variables.

Traditionally the use of behavioural measures and subjective metrics have been used to address cognitive factors associated with pilots or operators of safety critical systems. However, the advance in wearable physiology technologies could provide additional performance metrics directly driven from brain based measures, potentially validating subjective assessments and ultimately bringing us closer towards maintaining safe and effective performance. Furthermore, these techniques may also aid the design and evaluation of new technologies that are being presented as increasing operational capacity, efficiency and safety across the aerospace domain. The measurement of real time brain activity from the operator can help evaluate decision making, and reliably compare workload burden of next generation system versus legacy systems in the air transportation domain. This paper outlines key cognitive areas of interest when attempting to explore the correlation between physiological state changes and psychological constructs. A number of studies are described whereby wearable systems, namely electroencephalography (EEG), and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), are used to evaluate human performance. The potential advantages and challenges are discussed in relation to implementing these sensors in real operational settings.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

In this study, we have conducted a detailed analysis of kerosene fuel droplet heating and evaporation, using the previously developed discrete component model (DCM). Kerosene fuel composition (approximated by 44 components of the full composition reported in [4]) is replaced with 2 surrogate components to reduce the computational time. In contrast to the classical industrial analyses of aviation fuel (e.g. the distillation curve method [5]), the DCM takes into account gradients of species mass fractions in droplets. It is based on the analytical solutions to the heat transfer and species diffusion equations subject to appropriate boundary and initial conditions [6]. Numerical codes using these solutions were extensively verified and validated in [7–9]. The effective thermal conductivity and effective diffusivity approaches for moving droplets are used in the model. \nThe DCM was implemented in the commercial CFD software of ANSYS-Fluent which was applied to study the processes in a combustor. A polyhedral mesh was used for the hydrodynamic model. This opened opportunities for the simulation of the full combustion cycle. The influence of droplet evaporation on the combustion process was investigated. \nThe analysis was applied to a balanced mixture of kerosene and diesel fuels, represented in the ANSYS-Fluent database by C12H23 and C10H22, respectively. The initial droplet diameter and temperature were 100 µm and 375 K, respectively. The ambient gas temperature and pressure were 800 K and 4 bar, respectively. A co-axial air-blast atomizer was used with air and fuel mass flowrates of 0.175 kg/s and 0.003 kg/s, respectively, and an injection speed of 1 m/s. The evolution of droplet radii with time was predicted using three approaches, namely: 1) the results predicted by standard ANSYS Fluent software using constant properties; 2) the results predicted by ANSYS Fluent with the implementation of transient properties of fuel composition using the user defined function (udf), but without the DCM; and 3) ANSYS Fluent results with full implementation of the DCM and transient thermodynamic and transport properties.\nThe preliminary results show that the maximal impact of incorporating the DCM into the ANSYS-Fluent prediction of droplet evaporation is up to 10.4% compared to the case when a standard ANSYS-Fluent model is used. Also, our results indicate that the fuel composition and temperature gradient inside droplets, which are ignored in the standard ANSYS Fluent model, can lead to noticeable impact on the spray formation and combustion processes. The new results have been compared with those reported in the literature [12] for kerosene droplets of 1.8 mm initial diameter. General agreement between the numerical results and experimental data was found. In our analyses, we considered the impact of thermal-swelling on droplet evaporation. Finally, the combustion of the blended fuel droplets was simulated, and the influence of fuel evaporation and species diffusion on flame properties was investigated and will be presented in the full paper. \n\nReferences\n[1]\tAl Qubeissi, M., 2018, “Predictions of Droplet Heating and Evaporation: An Application to Biodiesel, Diesel, Gasoline and Blended Fuels,” Applied Thermal Engineering, 136(C), pp. 260–267.\n[2]\tSazhin, S.

Understanding the interaction across vehicle component levels is imperative to address the root cause of driveability issues.

In the context of emerging markets, however, international entrepreneurship scholarship still lags behind first world evidence. With less developed avenues for finance and limited infrastructure support for product development and service delivery, an assessment of internationalisation within emerging contexts is required. International Entrepreneurship in Emerging Markets presents insights from Brazil, China, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Turkey to enlighten scholars by unearthing the nature, drivers, barriers and determinants of entrepreneurship in emerging markets. It examines structural and environmental impediments to internalisation but demonstrates that these are far surpassed by the market opportunities and business readiness of SMEs in emerging environments. Readers of this tenth volume of the Contemporary Issues in Entrepreneurship Research series will find exclusive evidence from emerging countries, evidence that demonstrates the inclination of SMEs to revise products and, when appropriate, dissolve and recreate relationships in the face of market opportunity and uncertainty. Managers will learn that appropriating a range of attributes are more likely to achieve internationalisation. Capturing the true nature of value creation for international consumers and partners in an emerging market backdrop, this volume makes a significant contribution to the literature by mapping out the road to success within this diverse setting.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

These single point restraint systems may not provide similar levels of effectiveness when the crash scenarios vary with respect to the regulatory and consumer crash test procedures. Previous research has demonstrated that varying restraint deployment characteristics according to occupant and crash variation can provide further injury reduction in frontal impacts. This thesis reports the investigation conducted to assess the potential real world injury reduction benefit of smart restraint systems in frontal impacts. The intelligent capability of the restraint was achieved by varying the seat belt load limiter (SBL) threshold, according to the frontal crash scenario. Real world accident data (CCIS) were analysed to identify the target population of vehicle occupants and frontal impact scenarios where employing smart load limiters could be most beneficial, particularly in reducing chest injury risk. From the accident sample, the chest was the most frequently injured body region at an AIS 2+ level in frontal impacts (7% of front seat occupants). The proportion of older vehicle front seat occupants (>64 years old) with AIS 2+ injury was also greater than the proportion of younger occupants. Additionally, older occupants were more likely to sustain seat belt induced serious chest injury in low and moderate speed frontal crashes. Numerical simulations using MADYMO software were conducted to examine the effect of varying the load limiter thresholds on occupant kinematics and injury outcome in frontal impacts. Generic baseline driver and front passenger numerical models were developed using a 50th percentile dummy and were adapted to accommodate a 5th and 95th percentile dummy. Simulations were performed where the load limiter threshold was varied in five frontal impact scenarios which were selected to cover as wide a range of real frontal crash conditions as possible. From the simulation results, it was found that for both the 50th and 95th percentile dummy in front seating positions (driver and passenger), the low SBL provided the best chest injury protection, without increasing the risk to other body regions. In severe impacts, the low SBL allowed the dummy to move further towards the front facia, thus increasing the chance of occupant hard contact with the vehicle interiors. The Smart load limiters predicted no injury risk reduction for the 5th percentile drivers, who are shorter and tend to sit closer to the steering wheel. The potential injury reduction of the smart load limiters was quantified by applying the estimated injury risk reduction from the simulation to the real world accident data sample. Thoracic injury predictions from the simulations were converted into injury probability values using AIS 2+ age dependent thoracic risk curves which were developed and validated based on a methodology proposed by Laituri et al. (2005). Real world benefit was quantified using the predicted relative AIS 2+ risk reduction and assuming an appropriate adaptive system was fitted to all the cars in the real world sample. When applying the AIS 2+ risk reduction findings to the weighted accident data sample, the risk of sustaining an AIS 2+ seat belt injury reduced from 1.3% to 0.9% for younger front seat occupants, 7.6% to 5.0% for middle aged front seat occupants and 13.1% to 8.6% for the older front seat occupants. The research findings clearly demonstrate a chest injury reduction benefit across all age groups when the load limiter characteristics are varied. It suggests that employing a smart load limiter in a vehicle would not only benefit older occupants but also middle aged and young occupants. The benefit does appear to be most pronounced for older occupants, since the older population is more vulnerable to chest injury. As the older population of car users is rapidly rising, the benefits of smarter systems can only increase in the future.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Our results indicate that increased levels of strategic renewal positively relate to competitive advantage in conservative ventures, but not in opportunity-driven ventures.

Moves in the UK to link University funding to research activity have reinforced the importance of research to academia - however, this may also have had adverse consequences.

Institutional pressures on those conducting research may also have resulted in dysfunctional behaviour regarding the nature of the work conducted and the output. In the 1960s there was an attempt to make accounting research more \"scientific\", however, this seems to resulted in the emphasis on research methodology rather than the importance of making a contribution to knowledge. The lack of emphasis on the reliability (the reproducibility of the results) and validity (whether you are testing what you think you are testing) of statistical findings merely appears to have resulted in the application of pseudoscience to accounting research.

Canyoning (cf. canyoneering), is one such activity. In the Greater Blue Mountain World Heritage Area (GBMWHA), management was concerned that canyoning was causing environmental damage. However, there is a dearth of data, even on participation, because of the ‘composite’ nature of the activity, its recent emergence, and because adventure recreation is typically restricted to wilderness areas which renders visitor census problematic. Despite difficulties, management need to monitor such activities and a valid, reliable method of survey is required. For emerging forms of adventure recreation, identification of a representative sample is especially problematic. Often members of enthusiasts’ club are surveyed because sampling this demographic provides for an efficient and cost effective survey method, and wide geographical coverage. However, the representativeness of club members of the targeted population is questionable and thus results may not translate to valid/reliable outcomes. Despite issues, we found no concurrent studies of adventure recreation that compared club versus on-site sampling. Although canyoning in the GBMWHA (Australia) involves thousands of visits annually, no canyoning-specific clubs exist. A composite sport, it requires no specific equipment/clothing, and there are no formal competitive Australian events. The land managers are, therefore, faced with the issue of monitoring participation in, and developing policies for this, and other adventure recreation activities undertaken in wilderness.

In this paper, Schumpeter’s theories are used to explain how radical technological innovations in information-intensive industries are influencing the erosion of traditional industry and market boundaries leading to the emergence of new competitive business models and strategies. Developments in digital technology has resulted in new technology shifts and market linkages resulting in  dilemmas for the existing incumbents in traditional industries who find themselves increasingly trapped and victims of a new innovation logic (Abernathy et al. 1983, 1984, Kim et al. 1998, 2005). The new value innovation logic is being driven by entrepreneurs such as Page and Brin (Google) and Jobs (Apple) who are currently in the process of revolutionising the economic structures of many industries and creating new markets and organisational business models in a gale of creative destruction reminiscent of the theories developed by Sombart and Schumpeter (2006, 1975). This creation of new market models and their impact on established industries is explained further in the value chain evolution theory and its corollary sustaining innovation classification-scheme (Christensen et al. 2004). These theories reinforce the view that innovators, thinking in new and radical ways, provide sustainable new market developments and earn above the average revenues compared to incumbents, whose profit pools have eroded. This paper researches and analyses the impact that Google and Apple are having upon a broad range of information-intensive industries and the strategic options of the incumbent firms in the respective traditional industries in response to this radical change. Its purpose is to provide explanations of why and how radical innovators are able to redefine the rules of the market game leading to economic growth and development.

More than 90% were reportedly caused by falls from standing height [2], though in some cases there is no clear evidence of falls or trauma. From a biomechanical perspective, hip fractures are thought to be caused in real settings by different directions of loading. The force on the proximal femur during a fall causing hip fracture depends significantly on the density, thickness and stiffness of the body during impact. The process of fracture and its healing can only be understood in terms of structure and composition of the bone and also its mechanical properties. Bone fracture analysis investigates various failure mechanisms under different loading conditions. An accurate explicit finite element (FE) method would help scientists and researchers to predict the impact damage to bone structures. In this paper, the effect of low velocity impact on the osteoporosis hip in ageing people will be studied in LSDYNA. In the first part, SIMPLEWARE software is used to create a 3D reconstruction and registration of semi-transparent CT scan image data. In the second part, the effect of cortical thickness and impact velocity on the energy absorption of the hip during a fall will be investigated on a 3D model. State-of-the-art techniques are used. In part 3, validity of the FE method is evaluated by analysing the strength in the fracture of the contra-lateral femur. We examined whether our FE method could create a fracture in the contra-lateral femur which was identical to the real fracture. Discovering the critical impulse loading of hip would establish a benchmark to improve the design of safety instruments and consequently wellbeing of elderly people.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Allocating seminar and workshop groups outside large lectures requires close management and this case study considers how using digital technologies can improve the student experience by improving communication and consistent working practices for team tutors. Whilst it is well-established that students need to engage with various digital platforms to have graduate attributes expected in employment (Kärkkäinen and Vincent-Lancrin 2013), this can only happen if the Higher Education lecturers who are tasked with instilling digital fluency as part of teaching and learning, are competent themselves. It is usual for most lecturers to have a fair level of technological competency in some areas and it makes sense, then, to use digital techniques in managing a team of tutors for the delivery and assessment of large student cohorts.

Similarly, describing their artistic effort as that of archaeologists, historians, or entomologists is a delicate move: for on the one hand, their famous “Non, Non, Non” claim expresses their basic refusal of any sort of constraining etiquettes, while on the other hand their work still continues to be labeled in a number of ways, thereby demonstrating the impossibility to identify an ultimate footing that synthesizes the fascinating complexity of their oeuvre. Trying to locate my argument outside such rhetoric, what I wish to propose is not an alternative or further reading of Angela Ricci Lucchi and Yervant Gianikian’s artistic trajectory, but rather an attempt to imagine the philosophy innervating their work and to observe the gestures informed by it. From this point, my review of their films and video installations does not aim to provide a counter-description opposed to the several detailed accounts to which I am indebted, but to complement them by seeing these works as the crystallization of a specific way of conceiving time—a way that is apt to restitute the past, inhabit the present and look at the future. Their work employs a conception of temporality that transcends the diegesis, and which I believe cannot be solely described in terms of a feature typical of slow cinema. Conversely, I shall contend that this approach to temporality represents the most immediately recognizable—but at the same time, the densest aspect—of a very peculiar poetics that is merely the audio-visual output of a wider creative process and of a broader, personal and very concrete relationship with the world.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Recent research has paid some attention to the role of the dark triads in mate poaching. However, very little research has been conducted investigating the relationship between self-perceived mate value and intention to mate poach. We explored the role of the dark triads (Machiavellianism, narcissism and psychopathy), self-perceived mate value, and gender on one’s intention to mate poach in 81 participants from Coventry University. We find that the only dark triad to significantly predict intention to mate poach was psychopathy, suggesting those who scored higher on psychopathic traits were more likely to mate poach. Furthermore, we find that self-perceived mate value significantly predicted intention to mate poach, suggesting those who perceive themselves as having a high mate value, are likely to engage in mate poaching, which is a novel finding.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

While the news was not unexpected – the leader had been ill for some time – the response from the media and public alike was emotional and heartfelt. Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela had for many years been portrayed as a grandfatherly figure, a peaceful and good-spirited man of the people. Through images and discourse, the presentation of Mandela was one-sided – much of his pre-1994 struggle against Apartheid was glossed over in favour of the elderly, white-haired “Tata”, or grandfather, signification. How will Mandela’s image be memorialised? What is the predominant image of Mandela in popular memory? This paper therefore has three aims: to analyse the widely shared image of Nelson Mandela as represented through Google Images; to compare the juxtaposition of the Mandela image to the website on which it was found; and finally to compare the stereotyped image of Mandela to the predominant images of other leaders similar in statue and history. The conclusion suggests, in alignment with David Spurr’s (1994) theory, that non-Western leaders are of-ten stripped of their ability to cause action, the image being rather one of passive behaviour. This is an inductive visual rhetoric approach (Foss 2005:150). It is image-based, rather than rhetoric theory based, and pushes the boundaries of theory beyond the bounds of discourse. Thus, while Spurr discusses Rhetoric of Empire, I discuss the visual rhetoric of power – how power is fractured and fragmented through the visual positioning of human beings in photographs.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Although the optimization design is carried out for each part of the device, the system's own defect throwing cannot be avoided. In the period of low solar radiation density, the heat transfer fluid cannot continue to heat the hot water in the tank, resulting in a lot of heat loss. From the published literature in 2013, the solar collector temperature is lower than that of the hot water in the storage tank after 15:00, in this case the remaining solar energy will not be able to be storage, resulting in considerable energy loss, the same for the single-phase PCM storage. Hence, the authors suggested the cascade PCM storage to maxim the energy to be absorb and stored for the off radiation use. Different PCMs with various melting temperature will be used to storage the energy along the solar collect surface temperature curve. The results of the cascade PCM heat storage are compared with the sing-phase sensible and latent heat storage. The results show that the combination of cascade PCM technology and SWH system can improve system efficiency and solar energy fraction, and more number of PCM can get better heat storage performance. For a single-phase PCM storage mode, if the melting point of PCM is too high, the liquid fraction is too low and the PCM cannot store much energy; if the melting point is too low, the energy can only be obtained in the low temperature range. This paper can provide reference for the application of cascade PCM heat storage technology in the field of solar thermal storage.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Unfortunately, it is difficult for \"would-be-entrepreneurs\" to operate an informed choice given the large variety in nomenclature, programmes, services offered, underpinning business models, and the frequent lack of availability of performance data, or a common set of metrics that could be used to compute (and provide) widely acceptable KPI useful to facilitate the choice. Additionally, the role of the Information Management System has been under investigated. The present paper presents the research being conducted for the design and implementation of a modular information management system expressly designed to adapt to the needs of business incubators irrespective of the business model and approach adopted. The design is informed of the most relevant different business models presently adopted, the set of services and programmes offered, and the guidelines proposed by the European Union and the CSI federation. Best practices adopted in the UK and Europe have also been considered along with Cabral-Dahab principles. Finally, we identified a set of metrics that can be easily collected and used to generate valuable KPI able to support both the business incubation management as well as the applicants.

However, to date, research seems to be dominated by studies into English. Further, in the UK, CLIL initiatives in general have been limited, and this is particularly so in respect to community or heritage languages. This paper reports on a CLIL project on environmental pollution and the science of climate change with a community/heritage language, namely Greek, as the vehicular language. The project was implemented in the Greek supplementary school of Leicester, UK, and aimed at teaching students aged 11 to 17 scientific concepts (including those relating to the greenhouse effect, carbon cycle, climate change) while at the same time advancing language acquisition. It included various in-class activities and a visit to the Science Museum in London. Data collection included questionnaires, interviews, materials used in the activities and field notes to investigate the perceived impact of the project on heritage language learners. The ultimate aim of the research was to examine whether CLIL had a role to play in heritage language education, a field with distinct challenges. Gains were reported across language and content learning, cognition and attitudes. Perhaps the most significant finding was that the approach facilitated the building of linguistic and cognitive bridges between the students' linguistic heritage and their mainstream education. The article links classroom practice to research and argues for the inclusion of CLIL in supplementary schools, as an effective pedagogy for the teaching and learning of heritage languages.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

However, it is important to consider\nwhat EBP is and what it is not. In the workshop led by the Research\nand Evidence Based Practice committee (REBPc) of the European\nFederation of Associations of Dietitians (EFAD) as part of the 10th\nEFAD conference in Rotterdam, the role of dietitians was debated\nin the leadership EBP, quality, and audit.\nInitially, Christophe Matthys, Associate Professor from KU\nLeuven set the scene, by critically considering the gold standard\ndefinition of EBP as set out by Sackett (1996), with its 3 dimensions\nof research data, clinician experience, and patient preferences. The\nhistoric approach to practice based on clinical experience and continuing\npractice models have almost become habitual. To challenge\nand change the “we have always done things this way” mode\nof practice and move toward the integration of EBP in a real life\nsetting necessitates the involvement and interaction with a range\nof stakeholders. These stakeholders range from clinicians themselves,\nin this case dietitians, through the wider healthcare team,\nincluding nurses along with patients, healthcare commissioners,\nand politicians.\nAn example of how EBP guidelines have been developed and\nimplemented by the group in Leuven is dietary advice given prior\nto a colonoscopy (Vanhauwaert et al, 2015, Vanhauwaert, Matthys\n& Joossens, 2014). Following a systematic review, on which the\nguideline was based, 2 major conclusions were made. Firstly, the\nname of the diet needed to be changed, as “low residue” had too\nvariable meaning and could not be objectively defined. Secondly\nthe number of days that patients needed to follow the diet could be\nsignificantly reduced, which had the potential to reduce cost if patients\nwere in hospital as well as reducing the burden on the patient.\nAlthough, the logic to these conclusions are apparent, the\nfirst barrier these guidelines faced were that dietitians were reluctant\nto a change of name and a quantification of the diet. Then, the\nsecond key barrier came from nurses, who had a very specific perception\nof the diet, and how long it was necessary to follow, prior\nto the investigation. Therefore, highlighting that guidelines often\nhave to be adapted to allow it to be implemented and their need to\ncompromise the absolute findings from systematic reviewing of\nthe literature in order to effectively implement into practice,\nhealthcare teams need to be engaged and consulted in the process\n(Cochrane et al., 2007). This adaptive approach also means that\nguidelines can be adapted to suit the limitations of a healthcare\nsystem or meet the needs and priorities of the community they\nhave been developed to treat.\nThe need to support the effective implementation of dietetic\ntreatment depends heavily on monitoring how dietetic interventions\nare delivered and their outcomes. Elke Nauman, Associate\nProfessor from HAN, highlighted the work on data sets that need\nto be collected to demonstrate effective care and patient outcomes.\nIn previous studies, the group in HAN investigated what the minimum\ndata set should be, which needs to be collected by dietitians\ntreating patients at risk of cardiovascular disease to be able to demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of dietetic treatment.\nFollowing the identification of the minimum data set, further\nwork was undertaken to investigate facilitators and barriers in collection\nof this minimal data set. Then this will be used to develop\na digital tool that enables dietitians to register results of treatment.\nA semi-structured interviews methodology was used where dietitians\nwere used to identify facilitators and barriers for data collection.\nOutcomes were then used to develop a (draft) digital tool,\nusing “lean” methodology. Key facilitators and barriers were identified\nat the level of dietitians (e.g., experience in measurements),\nclients (e.g., expectation of dietetic treatment), organizations (e.g.,\ntime), and measurements (e.g., easy to use) and these were then\nused to develop a draft digital tool. It is important to use systematic\nmethodologies to develop draft digital tools that facilitates registration\n(Cooery et al., 2017). Whether this tool will indeed create\ntransparency of dietetic results needs to be confirmed.\nThe theme of data collection to improve dietetic practice and\npatient care and outcomes was continued by Dr Alison Stieber,\nfrom the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics who highlighted the\nvalue of ANDHII (https://www.andhii.org/info/#Intro ) as a fully\nfunctional health informatics infrastructure system. The value for\nthis type of approach helps to systematically use nutritional diagnosis,\ndietetic terminology, and monitor and evaluate patient care.\nThis allows for the economic evaluation of dietetic care, along with\nthe standardization of care and practice, resulting in improved patient\ncare and a greater ability to justify dietetic interventions.\nAlongside the approach to EBP and the need to monitor it using\neffective data capture, Dr Duane Mellor from Coventry University\nexplored the often forgotten role of the patient in EBP.\nBuilding on the adaptive approach to EBP explored by Associate\nProfessor Matthys, the importance of the patient voice was explored.\nThe role of the patient is key, as in EBP it has tended to have\nbeen overlooked (Gravel et al., 2006). However, in a world of person-\ncentred care, perhaps this could be seen as the most important\ncomponent, since if patients do not engage and follow the dietary\nadvice given, it does not matter how strong their evidence base is,\nthey will be ineffective (Siminoff, 2013). This concept is perhaps\neven more important in dietetics, as food is part of our individual\nand community culture, our dietary habits forming key aspects of\nour identities. It is therefore essential to consider how the patient’s\nvoice is included in developing EBP interventions that are effective\nin real world settings.\nThe development of EBP needs to consider how working cultures\nin healthcare influence the application of guidelines along\nwith how patients respond to these (Greenhalgh, Howick &\nMaskrey, 2014). After successfully achieving these challenges, robust\nmonitoring systems are necessary to demonstrate their effectiveness\nand justify services. The use of evidence and research in\ndietetic practice will be discussed further at the 11th EFAD Conference,\nRotterdam 28/29 September 2018 http://efadconference.\ncom.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Pre-positioned warehouses at strategic\nlocations are essential for this purpose to ensure the availability of supplies when\nrequired and to facilitate faster responses. However, some NGOs find it risky to operate\npre-positioned warehouses because it is both complicated and expensive given the\nlimitations in finance and resources. Indeed, pre-positioned warehouses for humanitarian\nrelief create various types of risks, but they haven’t been fully explored yet. This study,\ntherefore, aims to investigate the challenges in humanitarian relief operations relating to\npre-positioned warehouses. In specific, this research focuses on the interactions between\nvarious risk factors within the humanitarian logistics management in order to understand\nhow those challenges are generated and enhanced.\nDesign/methodology/approach:\nThe study adopted multi-phase mixed methods, combining semi-structured interviews\nand Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM). Firstly, it explored the main risk factors of\npre-positioned humanitarian distribution centres by interviewing with practitioners in the\nhumanitarian aid organisations. 25 Face-to-face and telephone interviews were\nadministered, February to April 2012, with 25 personnel at the managerial or higher level\nin the organisations. Secondly, the risk factors found out in the interviews are analysed\nby ISM, an analytic framework to encapsulate the relationships of specific elements in a\ncomplex system. After receiving the opinions of 10 experts on the pairwise relationships\namong the risks, the stepwise process of ISM generated the interactive structure of these\nrisk factors.\nFindings:\nThe interviews unpacked 17 representative risk factors that have considerable impacts on\nmaintaining pre-positioned warehouses, such as high inventory cost and failure in\nforecasting. The directed graph from ISM showed that the risks consist of three levels,\nnamely threats to the values of humanitarian logistics operations (Level 1), disturbances\nin logistics activities (Level 2) and disruptions by external factors (Level 3). Among them,\nLevel 2 risks were enhanced by three closed loops of risk interactions mainly centred on\nhigh transport cost.\nValue:\nThis research empirically identified various risks in operating pre-positioned warehouses\nfor humanitarian logistics and created a structure of risk interactions in order to\nunderstand how the challenges are generated and enhanced.\nResearch limitations/implications (if applicable):\nThis study confined its scope of research to the risks stemming from operations of prepositioned\nwarehouses. Future research can expand the research scope to the entire\nprocess of humanitarian relief logistics.\nPractical implications (if applicable):\nThe risk profile can provide a checklist for humanitarian logistics practitioners to assess\nthe level of risks in their operations. Given the levels and feedback loops of risk factors,\nthey can also find out which risk factor should be intensively mitigated to reduce the risk\nlevel.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

It will be the first time that three of works in the exhibition have been shown publicly.The pieces in this exhibition were the first body of work by Sutton to use plywood, and the construction of these began in early 1981. That year one of the first of these paintings was exhibited in New Works of Contemporary Art and Music which was hosted at the Fruitmarket Gallery in Edinburgh. In October 1981, Trevor Sutton had an exhibition called Assembly & Image Paintings at the Lisson Gallery in London. A review in the December issue of Artscribe by Chris Titterington described the work at the Lisson as a change that would give the critic plenty to talk about.Sutton had previously in the 1970s made multi-panel pieces, often made up of separate square and triangle shaped canvases. At the beginning of the 1980s he wanted to make something that seemed sharper, quicker and more immediate, whilst also being intimate ‘as if someone was looking in the mirror’. Sutton began working in his studio in Wapping on some drawings and diagrams, and decided to create the artworks from plywood rather than canvas. He then sent his diagrams and drawings to the artist George Meyrick who cut the plywood into shapes for him. Sutton would paint each plywood piece separately, when it came to assembly he would reconfigure and play with the order of the pieces, rather than simply assembling the pieces as he intended in the pre-emptive working drawings.The resulting work was something that had precise shapes, unlike the folds he found in the multi-part canvas pieces he created in the late 1970s. Many of these paintings were made on a human scale, almost ‘head sized’, and had titles that suggested to the viewer a reading that was slightly figurative. In 2015 Peter Jenkins described new works by Sutton as a creative analysis of observed qualities rather than representation, these works from the early 1980s could be seen to work in a similar way. Observation is an integral part of the creative process for Sutton, he makes notes and drawings of aspects he observes in the world, these are then synthesized into something new through an organic structure of improvisation.Trevor Sutton studied at Hornsey College of Art from 1967 until 71 where he met and was taught by the prominent abstract artist Gwyther Irwin. Sutton went on to complete a post-diploma in 1972 at Birmingham Polytechnic under the supervision of William Gear in the studios at Margaret St. After his studies, he left Birmingham and moved to London.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

For the first time the “born frees” (South Africans born after 1994, under democracy) will be voting in this fifth free general election. These “born frees” find themselves in a society still divided by the history of Apartheid – the digital divide grows daily, while socio-economic issues are deeply inherent in society. Much of the Western world is solidly in Age 3 of the political communication phases, defined by Blumler and Kavanagh (1999:213) as a multi-media “hydra-headed beast”, with media ubiquity and celerity. South Africa, however, is still stuck at the end of Age 2, with heavy reliance on television and radio for political communication, open-minded citizens but fed an empty diet of party political discourse (ibid). How could liberal democracy, something the South African constitution idealises, function under a divided society that has little access to adequate information or media plurality? Identity politics, as described by Friedman (2005:4), defines South African democracy. Even though the ruling African National Congress (ANC), frequently called the “struggle” party, offered the poor the least to gain pre-2009, the poor still voted for the party, simply because the ANC presents itself as “the party for the people”. Friedman (2005:5) develops this terminology, in that “identity” does not mean racial, primitive, irrational, or ethnic, but is instead a “social self-definition”. This form of voting can weaken democracy as identity loyalties could ensure that the government secures votes regardless of its performance. Friedman concedes that this is the system under which South Africans have been voting for at least a decade. With South Africa’s existent digital and educational divide, informed citizenry is difficult without media plurality and access to non-partisan information. \n\nInkuluFreeHeid (abbreviated to IFH) is a youth-led, non-partisan national organisation that uses new media combined with community outreach programmes to unite South Africans and organisations in encouraging freedom and access of information. IFH hosts South Africa’s first party political comparison website, combining this Age 3 media with community-led and owned soapbox rallies of Age 2 to encourage democratic engagement. \n\nThis paper thus begins a theoretical and critical discussion of South Africa’s regional democracy and of liberal democratic theory in the third age frame of political communication (Blumler & Kavanagh 1999, Friedman 2005, Piombo 2005, Gouws & De Beer 2008). Discussion then moves to barriers of informed citizenry in a still-divisive society such as South Africa, but also in relation to other third world / BRICS nations. Finally, the paper uses the presence of a non-governmental organisation, InkuluFreeHeid, as a case study for using new media combined with community development to encourage informed citizenry. The paper concludes by discussing the implementation of similar NGO activities to other Western non-Western countries.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

HPDL processing has resulted in crack and porosity free seals produced in normal atmospheric conditions. The single-stage grout is simple to formulate and easy to apply. Bonding of the enamel to the crushed ceramic tile mix was identified as being primarily due to van der Waals forces and, on a very small scale, some of the crushed ceramic tile mix material dissolving into the glaze. Optical inspection and water permeability tests revealed that a complete bond between the enamel glaze and the crushed ceramic tile mix, as well as between the enamel glaze and the vitrified surface of the ceramic tiles themselves, was achieved. The results of mechanical and chemical tests showed that the single-stage ceramic tile grout out performed the conventional epoxy tile grout in all the test areas. Life assessment testing revealed that the single-stage ceramic tile grout seals gave an increase in wear life of 4 to 42 times over conventional epoxy tile grout, depending upon the corrosive environment.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Yet when you dig below the surface, what emerges is a sector that is both resilient and responsive (Daley et al, 2015). At the heart of this lie the middle managers, a group whose role has changed considerably since the incorporation of colleges, to one that has moved away from a pedagogical focus to one that is concentrated on administrative and managerial tasks.  Current austerity measures and the shift towards the creation of larger organisations, has resulted in restructures that present opportunities for middle managers to participate in the strategic processes and leadership of the organisation.  The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of the middle manager within English further education, drawing out the leadership and management aspects. Whilst many managers in the sector are reluctant to identify as leaders (Briggs, 2006) our research shows that they are, in fact, undertaking a range of activities that could be classified as leadership. We suggest that using ‘practice’ rather than ‘process’ as a descriptor of the role of a middle manager would reframe the way the role is viewed and would help identify and bring to the fore, the leadership aspects of what they do.  Encouraging them to focus on a holistic, practice based, approach to the role, rather than concentrating on a succession of process driven tasks enables managers to have an increased clarity of vision which will help them expand their influence within the organisation and perform their role more effectively. The findings, taken from interviews with thirty-two participants and a questionnaire with 252 responses are used to illustrate our argument and demonstrate the need for leadership development within this key role.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The central argument of this study is that awarding self-government rights to national minorities would not be sufficient to create equality in Turkey’s culturally diverse society. The article points to potential injustices that might result from providing different treating to distinct groups in Turkey, and discusses these with reference to inter-group and intragroup inequalities.

However, to date, research seems to be dominated by studies into English. Further, in the UK, CLIL initiatives in general have been limited, and this is particularly so in respect to community or heritage languages. This paper reports on a CLIL project on environmental pollution and the science of climate change with a community/heritage language, namely Greek, as the vehicular language. The project was implemented in the Greek supplementary school of Leicester, UK, and aimed at teaching students aged 11 to 17 scientific concepts (including those relating to the greenhouse effect, carbon cycle, climate change) while at the same time advancing language acquisition. It included various in-class activities and a visit to the Science Museum in London. Data collection included questionnaires, interviews, materials used in the activities and field notes to investigate the perceived impact of the project on heritage language learners. The ultimate aim of the research was to examine whether CLIL had a role to play in heritage language education, a field with distinct challenges. Gains were reported across language and content learning, cognition and attitudes. Perhaps the most significant finding was that the approach facilitated the building of linguistic and cognitive bridges between the students' linguistic heritage and their mainstream education. The article links classroom practice to research and argues for the inclusion of CLIL in supplementary schools, as an effective pedagogy for the teaching and learning of heritage languages.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

In this paper, I do not intend to defend the frequent abjection, misogyny, racism and animal cruelty of Brutes and Savages. Instead, what I wish to argue is that, due to its running expository narration and the presence of Davis in the misappropriation of nation and location (including a fictional and nonsensical African country) - the film could be seen as a largely unacknowledged precursor to, and influence on, Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust (1980). In addition, I also propose that in Davis's Cecil Rhodes-inspired colonial buffoonery, however unintentional, Brutes and Savages also anticipates the documentary film's later evolution into a more performative mode of presentation (Michael Moore, Morgan Spurlock, Brian Herzlinger) in which 'truth' (including the image as both index and icon) and manipulation become increasingly more intertwined. States Nichols: 'At the heart of documentary is less a story and its imaginary world than an argument about the historical world' (1991, p111) - drawing on this quote, I will argue that Brutes and Savages, with its clumsy self-referential mythology and geographical ignorance, nonetheless posits that the future of documentary might be more commercially galvanised than necessarily 'truthful' or even journalistic. At the same time, I will conclude upon the film's impact on the Italian cannibal cycle.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Prior to processing and analyzing body models, it is significantly important to rotate them to the same orientation. For instance, body measurement systems and virtual try-on systems usually assume the orientation of the body is known. These systems will output incorrect results or report errors without the correct orientation information. Unfortunately, the orientations of scanned bodies are different in practice since they are in different coordinate systems due to the setup variations of scanners. To automatically normalize the orientations of bodies is a challenging task due to the presence of pose variations, noises, and holes during 3D body scanning. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning-based method dubbed OrienNormNet for normalizing the orientation of 3D body models. As shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, OrienNormNet directly consumes raw point clouds or mesh vertices, and it is applied in an iterative manner. First, the centroids of point clouds are translated to the origin to obtain zero-centered point clouds. Next, OrienNormNet consumes zero-centered raw point clouds and outputs coarse axis rotation angles. Finally, OrienNormNet takes the coarsely rotated point clouds from the previous processing as an updated input and outputs the refined axis rotation angles.

Some fans choose to use slide presentations set to music to perform their re-interpretive work—be it for technical/skills limitations, for stylistic reasons, or simply because their source material does not move. Diana Williams’s So Damn Hot is one such example, based as it is on the manga From Eroica with Love: a Japanese comic book with both a slash and yaoi fan following.

This requires a new way of approaching executive remuneration and the overall organizational reward strategy. This chapter analyzes corporate governance and CSR, highlighting areas of convergence and divergence; explores the benefits and synergies derivable from integrating both corporate practices; discusses the different models used to achieve an integration of corporate governance and CSR; it positions CSR and corporate governance in relation to the Global Financial Crisis and to executive remuneration practices. Executive remuneration is explored in light of the financial crisis and consideration is given to the rationale for approaching executive compensation through the integration of CSR and corporate governance.

It examines how they could be supported into entrepreneurship. This work presents stories of unemployed, female, social-housing residents residing in one of Birmingham’s most deprived neighbourhoods: Balsall Heath (BCC, 2015; Russell, 2018). These findings examine the entrepreneurship support needs and barriers of social-housing residents. Context: This work stemmed from a Birmingham-based housing association who recognised the potential of entrepreneurship as a means of economic empowerment for their female housing residents (Rafiq, 2014). In addition, a need to examine female entrepreneurs in the context of entrepreneurship education and training programmes had been identified (Bullough et al., 2015) as most entrepreneurship education studies focus on academic and higher education environments (Rae, 2003, 2005; Galloway et al., 2015; Scott et al., 2016). Therefore, this work co-creates knowledge with a critical lead partner in which it was envisioned that an entrepreneurship support programme inclusive of training and education could be developed for this female demographic. Method: Five data sets informed the results of this work; a local Housing Association (a critical lead partner) through participant observation and semi-structured interviews, female social-housing residents’ stories, a freelance Virtual Assistant housing association resident, stakeholders in the form of five local community organisations and researcher observations and insider perspective. Stories were collected from these data sets, as people are naturally narrative thinkers by which they arrange their lived experiences through stories (Graham et al., 2015). The methodology is presented as a multiple method case study which draws a boundary upon the data sets and context. Grounded theory analysis drew out the core themes prevalent within the data to derive theory using Rae’s practice-based theory (2004a). In particular, constructionist grounded theory was used as it enabled the researcher to acknowledge preconceived conceptions during research (Charmaz, 2008). This interpretive philosophy provided an exploration of lived experiences and social-housing residents’ interpretations of their social realities and structures (Saunders et al., 2016). Findings: An emergent model termed as ‘Lived Experiences’ is presented which categorises three variables; tangible experiences, capabilities and support. This conceptual framework seeks to define the lived experience barriers and challenges faced by socially disadvantaged groups such as female social-housing residents, whilst suggesting other sources and channels of entrepreneurship support. Value: There appears to be few entrepreneurship studies examining housing residents. This work contributes to knowledge on housing association residents and their entrepreneurial potential within the context of local-level entrepreneurship education targeting adults outside of academic environments (Rae, 2005b; Alberti et al., 2004). This paper contributes on a micro level to entrepreneurship and meso level, through entrepreneurship support providers, trainers and housing associations looking to diversify their residents’ capabilities through entrepreneurship. Finally, to entrepreneurship and context research (de Bruin et al., 2007; Zahra, 2007; Welter, 2011; Gaddefors and Anderson, 2017).", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Pp. 396. ISBN-13: 978-0-226-07665-2. ISBN-10: 0-226-07665-2 Few scholars would dispute the importance of what Steve Connor termed, in 2007, the “thingly turn” in literary studies—the pronounced shift, since the late 1990s, in the focus of literary criticism from language and form to the “stuff” that language and form describes.1 Borrowing from material culture studies—most notably, Arjun Appadurai and Igor Kopytoff’s edited collection, The Social Life of Things (1986), Daniel Miller’s edited collection, Material Cultures: Why Some Things Matter (1998), and Steven Lubar and W. David Kingery’s edited collection, History from Things (1993)—the first generation of literary materialist scholarship sought to demonstrate the socio-political charge of literary objects beyond that described by Marxist theory: which is to say, their capacity to illuminate not only systems of circulation and exchange but social dynamics and the pull of desire, aspiration, and memory, both within and outside the text. Now considered seminal, Douglas Mao’s Solid Objects: Modernism and the Test of Production (1998), David Trotter’s Cooking With Mud: The Idea of Mess in 19th-century Art and Fiction (2000), Elaine Freedgood’s The Ideas in Things: Fugitive Meaning in the Victorian Novel (2006), and Bill Brown’s A Sense of Things: The Object Matter of American Literature (2003) sought to render literary objects legible in order to render legible the texts in which they appeared. From the Colonial subtext of ivory in Jane Eyre (Freedgood) to the anxieties of Empire and rejection of Victorian values implicit in the scavenged materials in Virginia Woolf’s ‘Solid Objects’ (Mao), literary matter, they showed, is pullulating with tacit stories of its own—and can in turn provide a way into thinking about the object-status of literature itself.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

With a prevalence rate as high as 80% (EPRC, 2009), IPV ravages communities in the developing world not only by having harmful health impacts on victims (mostly women), but also by imposing financial costs on already impoverished populations of such countries (EPRC, 2009; Olayanju et al., 2013). However, for governments and other relevant stakeholders to act and prevent this malaise, there is a need to have better understanding of the costs it imposes on the society (i.e., an estimation of the costs it imposes on individuals in the various communities). This will help appropriate the right amount of resources needed to address the problem. Nevertheless, most developing countries, especially those in Africa, are yet to robustly explore these financial/costs impacts (Duvvury et al., 2004; WHO, 2010). To contribute towards bridging this chasm in knowledge, this paper is based on a cross-sectional population-based survey and explores the costs of IPV in a developing country, Nigeria, via a bottom-up approach (i.e., estimating costs across households). Using a pre-tested questionnaire to solicit appropriate data, a dataset of 719 Nigerian households was collected. This was explored with accounting and economics methodologies such as unit cost analysis, household production and human capital approaches. The resultant findings indicate that IPV is a major drain on household finances. It imposes an average unit cost per incident of ₦16,465.66 (approximately, $83 US Dollars) on each household, despite the fact that large proportions of the country (approximately 100 million people) live on less than $1 US Dollar per day. The findings from this study provide a strong indication of the need for an urgent preventive action on IPV, so as to save lives and rescue people (both current and future generations) from poverty, in addition to reducing all other debilitating health, psychological and social effects resulting from it.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The patients were given one afternoon per week to attend RIPPLE club, where they could not only speak to similar sufferers and make friends, but they gained support and treatment from their GP and specialist respiratory nurses in a social environment without having to attend clinics.  Some 30-40 acutely ill and isolated patients kept returning and reporting an increasing positive upturn in their mental wellbeing as well as improving the self-management of their condition.  Part of the extended social activities arranged for the respiratory group were Mindfulness, Breathing techniques, Bingo, Quizzes and Drawing and Colouring. Mindfulness and Drawing allows time to let the mind and pencil wander, to focus on the moment, just being here and now, not worrying or concerned with what is before or after.  To improve concentration and appreciation of your present self and surroundings.  A new way of seeing the world which also feeds into the drawing activities. Mindfulness is practiced as an accepted form of treating stress and long term health issues.  Collaborative drawing and art activities, amongst other group activities on offer, provide a very low cost model with benefits which go beyond the initial treatment intended for these COPD sufferers.

These practices enabled them to: understand social hierarchies; access a wider range of symbolic codes/materials and reduce the risk inherent in identity experimentation.\nResearch limitations/implications – The sample size was small and limited to one geographical area and older teens (16-19 years). Future studies could explore the prevalence and characteristics of these behaviours more widely.\nPractical Implications –Provides insights into the everyday practices of teen consumers and the stimuli that engage their attention. This provides opportunities for advertisers to emulate “voyeuristic” scenes and practices (e.g. gossip) into their creative approaches to enhance young consumer engagement and reduce perceived risk in identity experimentation.\nSocial Implications – Socially accepted “mediated voyeurism” in SNS has reconfigured social norms around privacy, disclosure and observation of others. There are inherent risks in these behaviours however SNS widen teens’ scope for social comparison, self-evaluation and self-enhancement thereby improving their ability to develop coherent identity positions.\nOriginality – This paper provides a valuable insight into the emerging behaviours of young consumers in digital environments.

Specifically the RSVP Cycle, a conceptualization of collaborative creative processes by American outdoor movement artist Anna Halprin, is discussed as a way to position technology in a flattened hierarchy of resources for art making. \n\nIn dialogue with the work of performance studies scholar Professor Susan Melrose, (2003, 2005a, 2005b & 2005c), artists’ activity and achievement is argued to rely upon what might be referred to as inter-subjectivity between artists and situation, rather than wholly situated in an embodied singular self.\n\nAcknowledging the ontological provocations that lay amongst the creative approach of enter inhabit this chapter concludes by briefly considering the work of performance theorists Peggy Phelan (1993) and Rebecca Schneider (2002) to chart the significances of a collaborative process that resists casting the live or virtual as ‘document’ to the other and instead positions each as a creative act in companionship. Offering case study examples inherent to the work of enter & inhabit; the digital image, web space creation, remote score writing and virtual dancing, this chapter argues that technology is both a constitute part of the work itself and a reflective (or perhaps refractive) tool embedded into our creative process that contributes, alongside other elements, to the play of relationship between bodies and site.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Monopsony power in agriculture is a growing threat to the operation of agricultural product markets. The United Kingdom (UK) dairy industry depicts a good example of the possible ripple effects of consolidation. This is an industry that gives employment to nearly 85,000 people and accounts for 10% of the total food production in the country. However, dairy producer numbers in the UK are falling by approximately 4% each year (Dairy Co, 2010a). The unbalanced weighting of market power -- within the dairy supply chain -- has impacted the scope of innovation of some dairy farmers. This lack of innovation in terms of product innovation and operational innovation seems to be one of the reasons for the declining number of dairy farmers. The structure of the dairy sector is expected to undergo restructuring and further rationalization in response to a reduction of international tariffs and deepening economic integration. Within this context, this paper aims to shed some light on the potential role of vertical integration as a suitable strategy to improve the competitiveness of British dairy farmers. Vertical integration strategy may be a potential solution to the problems of innovation because it allows increased responsiveness to consumer needs as communication can move through the supply chain more effectively. The contribution of this paper is to explore the relevance of vertical integration strategy in overcoming some of the challenges of UK dairy producers. Qualitative data from this study suggests that vertical integration is too costly for many dairy producers and represents a major shift from current practices. Those wishing to implement a vertical integration strategy will have to change the management structure, the divisional structure of the firm, and the information flow within the business.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

While the origins of visual music lie in the early colour organ inventions or the paintings of artists such as Kandinsky, ‘visual music’ as a form of experimental film-making in the mid 20th Century was pioneered by artists such as John Whitney, Oskar Fischinger, Jordan Belson and others. John Whitney sought to provide a form of ‘visual harmony’ that mirrored that provided within music (Whitney, 1981). Jordan Belson’s work explores similar approaches, but was particularly concerned with the use of abstract visuals in order to reflect music of the ‘inner eye’, which related aspects of internal experience. Perhaps the most well known example of visual music however is Walt Disney’s Fantasia (1940), which uses animated cartoon narratives to reflect well-known orchestral pieces of music.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

In order to evaluate the shifting understanding and development of this process in Turkey, the first written documents can be dated to the year 1509 in which a strong earthquake struck İstanbul, the capital of the Ottoman Empire. The 1509 earthquake was one of the foremost hazardous events recorded in the history of Turkey (Bayrak, 1996; EvangelatouNotara, 2001; Ambraseys and Finkel, 2006). The earthquake, which occurred on September 14, was named “Little Doomsday” (Griffiths et al., 2007). According to the report of the Research Commission of the Turkish Parliament, the magnitude of the earthquake is estimated between 7.6 and 8.0, and human loss was assumed as 13,000 (TBMM, 1999). The same report stresses that following the earthquake, which severely damaged 109 mosques and 1,047 buildings, the Ottoman Emperor (Sultan Beyazıt the Second) prepared and disseminated a mandate in which 50,000 building craftsmen and workers between 14 and 60 years old were assigned to work in rehabilitation and reconstruction of the destroyed city. In addition, the same mandate prohibited construction of buildings on filled grounds of the coastal areas, as well as trying to force the construction of timber-framed housings instead of construction using heavy materials such as stones.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

This paper presents a new method to detect broken rotor bars in induction motors using a new vector approach. This new vector is a function of the zero-sequence current and any of the three phase stator currents.

To improve opportunities and outcomes Gender Mainstreaming has been adopted as an objective of transport policy in Europe but adoption on a country level has been fragmented. Mobility needs are evolving, Gender relevant aspects of a smart city, mobility, safety, security, employment and sustainability have already been identified as fields of action in previous research however whilst Smart Mobility is advancing choice and offering more sustainable modes of transport it is not clear whether these advancements will be advantageous to all groups in society. This paper discusses ethical issues relating to equity in mobility with a focus on intersections of gender, race and class. We relate how unequal access to space in the context of smart mobility increases vulnerability to social exclusion related transport poverty and discuss how incorporating the theory of intersectionality into transport policy can build on advancements already made through the adoption of gender mainstreaming. Our discussion of the operationalization of intersectionality in smart mobility is a timely one in the era of COVID-19 and has to become a catalyst for more equitable and sustainable smart mobility", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

It is one thing to write a good scientific paper, however it is quite another thing to get it published. This requires some additional nous. In writing this book Don Harris draws upon nearly a quarter of a century of experience as an author and reviewer of research papers, and ultimately as a journal editor. By his own admission, it contains all the things he wished that his mentors had told him 25 years ago, but didn't. The material in the book is drawn from many years of finding all these things out for himself, usually by trial and error (but mostly error!). The text adopts a much lighter touch than is normally found in books of this type - after all, who really wants to read a book about writing research papers? The author describes his own unique approach to writing journal papers (which, in his own words, has proved to be extremely successful). All major points are illustrated with examples from his own, published works. The book is written in the form of a manual for constructing a journal manuscript: read a chapter, write a section. However, the material it contains goes beyond just this and also describes how to select a target journal, the manuscript submission process, what referees are looking for in a good journal paper, and how to deal with the referees' comments.

Such processes typically involve the use of automated computer controlled machining centers, which, in principle, are capable of sustained periods of unattended operation. However, the quality of the finished product, in terms of its conformance to dimensional and surface finish requirements as specified in the design, is strongly dependent upon the condition of the cutting tools used. A number of tool life management systems have been designed and engineered and are employed in production environments today, but these are usually based on expired life criteria and are of limited applicability. Crucially, in the context of increasing product life cycles, the disguarding of tools earlier than may be necessary is wasteful, expensive and inconsiderate to the environment. More sophisticated designs do exist, typically based on advanced technologies, such as acoustic emission or spindle torque sensors, for dynamically sensing tool condition during operation. Such systems are potentially more useful but still only indicate that some aspect of the cutting process has changed and usually require human intervention.

Hypotheses predicted that eudaimonic and hedonic well-being would be positively predicted by left prefrontal dominance and higher levels of basic need satisfaction. \nMethods & Design: An opportunity sample of students (N = 64; M age = 21.17, SD = 3.65; males n = 32, females n = 32) completed self-report measures of basic need satisfaction, hedonic, and eudaimonic well-being, and underwent baseline recordings of electroencephalography (EEG). A combination of methods was used to further investigations on links between neural factors and cognitive variables of need satisfaction and well-being. Results: Regression analyses revealed hedonic well-being was weakly predicted by right side dominance in frontocentral EEG activity and weak to moderately predicted by basic need satisfaction. Eudaimonic well-being was weakly predicted by right side dominance in frontocentral EEG activity and moderate to strongly predicted by basic need satisfaction. The EEG and basic needs displayed unique effects on well-being with the basic needs showing a greater influence.\nConclusions: Reported satisfaction of the basic needs of competence, autonomy and relatedness show a greater influence on hedonic and particularly eudaimonic well-being compared to links with right side dominant prefrontal EEG activity. Links with brain asymmetry did not follow the expected direction and whilst links with well-being were weak relative to basic needs, more research is required to substantiate the nature and reliability of the relationship between neural factors and well-being.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Similarly, the small cohort size might make any conclusions only appropriate to the cohort studied.\n \nPractical implications \nIn establishing common factors that enhance SDL skills, teachers can develop their professional pedagogic practice to improve student engagement in learning. Further, by understanding cultural differences in this context, one can differentiate practices to mixed nationality groups.\n \nSocial implications \nIn understanding how teaching practice can enhance the development of SDL, educators can help develop key skills to aid students in their preparations for the world of work. \n \nOriginality/value \nThis research offers an insight into how post graduate students of HRD within a British university can be appropriately supported through particular acts of teaching practice, to enhance their capacity to self-direct, key to both employability and learner engagement. Until now, recent studies into SDL have focussed typically on medical education elsewhere in the world.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

This makes the field of Rock Mechanics – in particular the use of Finite Element Analysis [FEA] in studying the behaviour of the rock under cutting conditions where many parameters are involved - a challenging area to explore. Here experimental results are needed to justify and verify the results from FEA modelling. Based on the Brazilian Test this paper analyses three types of rocks namely – limestone, sandstone and shale, which belong to the sedimentary rock category with sandstone having greater strength than limestone and shale. The Finite Element-Discrete Element coupled method (FEM-DEM) used in the proposed modelling enables the facture process of the rock to be studied closely in relation to the cutting force component causing the start of fracture and the behaviour of the propagating crack during this process. These results should prove to be useful in analysing the fundamental behaviour of the rock material at the extreme cutting edge of the tool.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The findings of Study 1 support the notion that spelling is a multifaceted process integrating phonological, morphological, semantic and orthographic skill (Frith 1980). The aim in Study 2 was to narrow the focus on the variables found to be most strongly associated with lexical and sublexical processes for spelling and to investigate language transfer effects. Factors associated with spelling in English of bilingual children with more or less experience with Greek were examined. Children with stronger Greek literacy skill showed more influence of phonological processes than those with weak Greek literacy skills. In Study 3, three variables were investigated in relation to the single word spelling performance of a new sample of Greek and English monolingual and bilingual children. These were phonological ability (associated with sublexical processes), and visual memory and letter report (both associated with lexical processes). The findings from Studies 1, 2 and 3 indicated that, despite the difference in transparency between Greek and English, lexical processes seem to play a more important role in spelling for monolingual children than phonologically-based processes with increasing age.

Rapid Assessment of the Inhalation Resistance Performance of Uncertified Medical Face Masks in the Context of Restricted Resources Imposed during a Public Health Emergency", "year": "2020", "authors": ["Profiles"], "author_urls": ["https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/"], "abstract": "In the case of a public health emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic, access to large quantities of appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) has presented a significant problem. A shortage of face masks and respirators has been widely reported across the world. A concerted effort to manufacture high volumes has not unsurprisingly put pressure on the supply chain and the important certification processes. PPE procured or donated as uncertified stock requires rigorous, expedient and scientifically informed evidence before decisions can be made regarding suitable deployment, expensive certification, return or possible destruction of stock. This paper reports a series of experiments devised in reaction to this situation. In this study, an experimental methodology for the assessment of the filtration performance of samples of real-world, uncertified, fluid resistant surgical masks (FRSM type IIR) was evaluated in the resource limited (lockdown) environment of the COVID-19 pandemic. A steady-state flow rig was adapted to incorporate a bespoke filter flow chamber for mounting face masks in order to evaluate the resistance to air flow as an indicator of mask inhalation performance. Pure air was drawn through a specified control surface area at known flow rate conditions; the resistance to the air flow through the masks was measured as the resulting pressure drop. Over 60 tests were performed from 4 different, randomly sampled batches and compared to a control sample of EN Type IIR certified FRSM masks. Steady-state volumetric airflow rates of 30 and 95 lmin-1 were chosen to represent deep breathing and vigorous exercise conditions respectively. The results showed that the sample masks produced a pressure drop of between 26% to 58% compared to the control batch at the lower flow rate and 22% to 55% at the higher rate. The results for each sample were consistent across both flow rates. Within the group of masks tested, two sets (between 48% and 58% of the reference set) showed the potential to be professionally assessed for appropriate deployment in a suitable setting. Although the absolute values of pressure drop measured by this method are unlikely to correlate with other testing approaches, the observed, indicative trends and relative performance of the masks is key to this approach. Critically, this method does not replace certification but it has enabled a public body to quickly make decisions; certify, re-assign, refund, thus saving time and resources. The total time spent conducting the tests was less than 8 hours and the low cost method proposed can be repurposed for low resource regions.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The research questions guiding this investigation asked two things: how was the 1994 election portrayed on global North television news, and whether journalists used mediatised reporting (including neoliberal narratives, post-Cold War frames, and media logic) to describe the election. This paper presents firstly an overview of relevant literature pertaining to themes of reporting about elections, secondly a brief description of the methods of investigation including the dedicated analysis technique, and thirdly the findings from the research. This paper ends with a discussion about the narratives of the 1994 election and concludes by comparing the mediatised reporting in 1994 to the \"trumpification\" of journalism in recent years.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

A key facet of contemporary supply chain management (SCM) thinking is the shift away from traditionally fragmented supply chain configurations to ones that are characterised by high levels of integration of supply chain processes and data. Experience suggests that success in achieving higher levels of supply chain integration (SCI) depends on both physical and technical aspects (ie the so-called ‘hard-wiring’), as well as human and behavioural components (ie the so-called ‘soft-wiring’). It would appear, however, that the latter has received relatively little attention in the LSCM academic literature. Furthermore, the empirical evidence suggests that the majority of supply chain improvement initiatives in companies have been primarily concerned with technological, structural and process issues. This paper argues that the difficulties often encountered in attempting to put LSCM theory into practice are largely a consequence of a lack of focus on, and understanding of, the human dimension. Based on this discussion, the paper offers some suggestions for improvement in this area to both the supply chain research and practitioner communities. It uses several cultural and literary references throughout to illustrate these suggestions.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The risk management process identifies, obtains and documents relevant information about risks, facilitates evaluation and analysis of risks for alternative network and product/service configurations and also helps constitute plans for risk mitigation. The role of network partners and their characteristics, including geographical variations, are taken into account while interdependencies between partners and propagation of risks are also considered. Risk scenarios related to supply, production, logistics, demand, information and control, and external risks are included and a generic catalogue of potentially relevant risks are provided to bootstrap the process. The process model recommends documentation of historical information about incidents to be carried out continuously which can be later utilised to improve speed and accuracy of risk management. Also, by explicitly considering uncertainty level of provided information, continuous improvement in information availability within the process has been recognised, the accuracy and applicability of the analysis can be measured and appropriate action can be taken to improve the accuracy, as needed.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The role of a Marine Designer is to create and execute design solutions for problems of form, usability,\nergonomics, marketing, brand development, and sales. Based on the principles of Industrial Design, the objective of\nwhich is to study both function and form, and the connection between product (vessel or system), the user and the\nenvironment. User Centred Design (UCD) is a process in which the needs, requirements, and capabilities of crew\nmembers as end users of a vessel or system, are given extensive consideration at each phase of the design process. UCD\nis a sequenced problem solving process that requires marine designers to analyse and anticipate end user behaviour in\nworking on a vessel or system, and to test the validity of these assumptions through ethnographic analysis of real users.\nEthnographic analysis is necessary due to the challenge for marine designers to intuitively understand the experiences of\na first-time user (crew member) of their vessel or system design. UCD answers questions about users, their tasks and\ngoals, then uses the findings to inform the design process with specific user scenarios. This paper reports on an\nethnographic analysis carried out onboard a WFSV to evaluate current navigational practices and other command and\ncontrol activities specific to WFSV, including technician transfer to the turbine. The ethnographic analysis informed an\nergonomic analysis carried out using the Digital Human Modelling (DHM) software RAMSIS, which allowed the bridge\ndisplays to be evaluated in the virtual design space", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

This analysis is based on a hypothesis that droplets remain spherical. This hypothesis, however, is not always consistent with experimental observations: liquid structures can be widely deformed.\n\nTo investigate the deformation of droplets, and liquid structures of any shape, one can use an interface tracking method. This method is very attractive as it allows the interface to be directly resolved. In this context, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved directly and jump conditions (change in density and viscosity across the interface) are taken into account with advanced numerical methods. This kind of simulation is called Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of two-phase flows. ARCHER (in-house code) can be used to perform DNS of the above-mentioned two-phase flows. This code has been widely used and was one of the first to be used to perform DNS on Diesel injection [2]. Phase change has also been added recently following the Tanguy et al. method [3]. A comparison between the ELSA model and DNS has been performed to evaluate the ELSA model [4]. The main objective of this work is to investigate the link between modelling and DNS. The DNS will be used as a benchmark to check the validity of currently available droplet heating and evaporation models models, and the feasibility of their improvements will be investigated. \n\nOnly a few studies have considered the evaporation using DNS of two phase flows. Using this method, an extended study can be performed by analysing DNS of a deformed moving droplet and static droplet to check the validity of heating and evaporation models, with particular emphasis on the Abramzon-Sirignano model [1], widely used in engineering applications. This model uses the Effective Thermal Conductivity (ETC) submodel to take into account the contribution of the vortices inside moving droplets on droplet heating and evaporation.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The AMHP replaced the Approved Social Worker. Using a social constructionist perspective, this study has explored the decision-making of ten social work and ten nursing AMHPs in England. The purpose was to see if the decision making relating to management and assessment of risk varies according to the professional background of the AMHP. The study used an experimental vignette with each participant of audio-visual material containing mock health and social care records undertaken within a semi-structured interview. This study found that there was no difference in detention rates across the two groups studied in this research and found variance across the whole sample relating to the risks that were identified in the vignette. The findings suggest that there are differences in the way individual AMHPs reach decisions and in the factors that contribute towards that decision. Assumptions about discipline-related differences in social work and nurse decision-making have been challenged in this study. There is evidence to suggest that experience working in mental health was what AMHPs felt was the most significant factor contributing to their perception of risk. Overall, AMHPs expressed a good level of confidence in their practice as AMHPs. This study also highlighted that the majority of participants have felt afraid during a Mental Health Act assessment, and it illuminated how intuition and feelings have a role in how detention decisions are reached. The conclusion of this study gives rise to the need for further investigative research.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

On the one hand, it is estimated that up to 40 % of the globally produced food is lost or wasted every year, on the other hand about 925 million people suffer from malnutrition. In addition, food production has to be increased by 70 % to feed a population of 9 billion people in 2050. Due to these estimations, it becomes increasingly important to start initiatives to reduce food waste and its impact on natural resources. One reason why fruits and vegetables are wasted in developed countries is aesthetic standards set by retailers. Aesthetic standards regulate the shape and appearance of fruits and vegetables. Retailers have set these standards based on the assumption that consumers are only willing to buy fruits and vegetables without any cosmetic flaws. The result is that produce which are misshapen are sorted out in advance and go to waste. Within this context, this paper has two main objectives: first, to explore the attitudes of consumers towards fruits and vegetables with cosmetic flaws; and second, to unveil how these attitudes influence consumers’ purchase intentions. A survey was conducted for this research in order to investigate whether this food waste is avoidable or not. A total of 213 participants from Germany took part in the survey. The results of this research indicate that consumers in Germany are potentially willing to buy misshaped fruits and vegetables and have a positive attitude towards them. However, the degree of willingness and the attitude of consumers depend on the price of the product and on the type of cosmetic flaw. Based on the assumption that consumers are willing to buy misshaped fruits and vegetables, retailers have the possibility to take responsibility and ease their aesthetic standards for an additional offer of misshaped products. This Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative would create environmental and social benefits as well as economic benefits for the retail sector.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

They comprise a complex network of pipelines buried underground that are relatively inaccessible. Maintaining the integrity of these networks is vital for providing clean drinking water to the general public. There is a need for in-situ, on-line monitoring of water distribution systems in order to facilitate efficient management and operation. In particular, it is important to detect and localize pipe failures soon after they occur, and pre-emptively identify 'hotspots', or areas of the distribution network that are more likely to be susceptible to structural failure. These capabilities are vital for reducing the time taken to identify and repair failures and hence, mitigating impacts on water supply. WaterWiSe is a platform that manages and analyses data from a network of intelligent wireless sensor nodes, continuously monitoring hydraulic, acoustic and water quality parameters. WaterWiSe supports many applications including dynamic prediction of water demand and hydraulic state, online detection of events such as pipe bursts, and data mining for identification of longer-term trends.

This rapid evidence assessment has reviewed the academic and grey literature globally to establish key factors that impact on mental health across five sectors responsible for critical social and economic infrastructure – maritime/energy; construction; engineering; food and digital. Structural factors in the organization of workplaces and safety practices impact upon the psychological wellbeing of employees and are in turn affected by the emotional and behavioural consequences and diminished psychological wellbeing. The Power Threat Meaning Framework (PTMF) provides a way of modelling this relationship that avoids some of the difficulties inherent in global approaches to mental health. The evidence clearly shows that psychosocial factors play a central role in mediating the relationship between structural aspects of the working environment and psychological wellbeing. Whilst there is wide variability in the efficacy of interventions attempted across the sectors explored, in general, strategies which employ a holistic approach to psychological wellbeing generally demonstrate better outcomes. On the basis of the available evidence, we recommend that interventions proceed by identifying and modelling the specific configuration of psychosocial factors within a given sector or organization. We further recommend that participation in interventions is facilitated collaboratively, and designed across all levels within the organization. The 4th Industrial Revolution offers many challenges to all the sectors explored and is generally considered in terms of the direct and indirect threats it poses to psychological wellbeing through exacerbating existing workplace inequalities. However, technological changes also offer innovative means through which mental health may be monitored. The evidence base also provides some key lessons for the transitions every sector will have to make during and in recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

There are about 152,000 strokes in the UK alone every year where about 1.2 million people live with the afer efects. The carotid arteries are located on each side of the neck and are the blood vessels which supply blood to the large front part of the brain which is where thinking, speech, personality, and sensory and motor functions reside. Each common carotid artery divides in two branches: the internal carotid artery and the external carotid artery. Normal these arteries are smooth; however, over time plaques, made of cholesterol, calcium, destructed cells and fbrous tissue, build up on the walls - a process known as atherosclerosis. Extensive atherosclerosis may cause stenosis (narrowing) of the artery or even complete blockage. In the carotid artery, this typically occurs at the bifurcation where the common carotid artery divided into the internal and external arteries. Many studies have considered the blood fow, as well as associated parameters such as wall shear stress, in arteries with varying degrees of stenosis; however, this only provides a snap-shot in time and does not give any information on the progression of the disease. Here we consider a numerical model for stenosis development, based on the haemodynamic properties inside the artery. This enables the development of an understanding of the role of the blood fow in stenosis development, and the two-way interaction between the interaction between the blood fow and the developing stenosis. Blood fow is simulated using the Lattice Boltzmann Method, while the development of the stenosis is governed by the simulated haemodynamic conditions in the wall region. Details of the stenosis growth model will be presented, including details of its development and application. Simulation result will also be presented indicating how the stenosis develops and how the corresponding geometrical changes afects the near wall fow parameters.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Pp. 296. ISBN-13: 9780252097850. “Whenever we talk about war literature, we are always, however implicitly, also talking about the question of how war literature is either resisted, accepted, or both. Posed in one form or another, the anti-war question will always be there,” Giorgio Mariani tells us in the introductory chapter of Waging War on War: Peacefighting in American Literature (8). Few attempts however have been made to date, to conceptualise or define anti-war literature as a genre in its own right. While the field of war studies continues to expand, new work in this area tends to either assume that “all war writing is at bottom anti-war writing” (9, emphasis in the original)—a view Mariani shows to be both critically and politically problematic—or to avoid the question altogether. This absence, he argues, is partly due to the innate difficulty of defining the subject: a text’s “anti-war credentials” shift according to its reader, while war literature as a whole can be seen to grapple to a greater or smaller extent with the ethical complexities of culturally-justified or condoned violence. The discussion of war in Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse 5, and Vonnegut’s own desistance from terming his novel “anti-war”highlights these difficulties: Vonnegut is aware of the antinomy at the heart of his novel, and if he hesitates in calling it an anti-war novel, this is probably because he himself does not know what exactly this literary object consists of. Is it a tale that indignantly attacks the madness of war, even though wars need to be fought? A story that promotes a wholesale condemnation of War—any war, no matter how “just”? Or is it a narration that purports to help us understand the causes of war? Should an anti-war novel unambiguously rail against the monstrosity of human slaughter? Or, as many argue, should a war narrative only present the real or imagined thoughts and actions of men and women at war, leaving explanations to politicians and historians?

These social determinants of health include access to health care and necessary social services. But these rights are often not realised both in developing countries like the USA and in the emerging nations such as China, India and Brazil. Even where access to free universal health care has been secured, such as in the UK, current policy developments threaten to undermine the position.\n This paper examines the role of neo-liberal economic and political forces over the past twenty five years in preventing the achievement of the right to health and social services through two case studies. In Brazil, neo-liberal policies have been a barrier to the achievement of universal health and social care despite progress on some fronts. In the specific case of the Brazilian health policy, the twenty-three years following the Federal Constitution (1988) are characterized by ongoing tension between two principles: the construction of universality and cost containment. This conflict is far from resolved. The public health system (SUS) does not have a defined source of funding. It was created without the option to prioritize the public system, because this priority is incompatible with the continuation of incentives for private health care within the present tax system. To guarantee adequate resources to finance a universal public health service, as established in the Constitution of 1998, would require a new “health reform” that would redefine the SUS as the primary agent of health care. In England, but not in other countries in the UK, the principles that have underpinned the national health service (NHS) are under attack and universal comprehensive health care, free at the point of delivery, is becoming a thing of the past. Successive governments led by both major political parties have colluded in substituting a market driven health care system for the previously publicly administered service despite the absence of an electoral mandate. The medical industrial complex has lobbied ministers successfully and the global financial crisis has been used as an excuse for dismantling the NHS. By examining the role of neo-liberalism in these developments and the different forms of opposition in the two countries, this paper will draw conclusions about the impact of neo-liberal policy making on inequalities in health and the implications for social work and social development.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

To study social networks of entrepreneurial teams, this study employs the conceptual model of Hoang and Antoncic (2003) to study the characteristics of social networks. The results from an examination of the sample of 181 Spanish university spin-offs demonstrate that by exploiting social networks an entrepreneurial team can shape its capabilities, which in turn improve its ability to access external seed investments. Thus, the paper has implications for universities in training and policy development to support spin-off’s activity, especially to build entrepreneurial teams with capabilities to pitch to the focused seed capital providers.

While an emerging body of research (i.e. Chakraborti and Garland 2004) has begun to challenge ‘problem-free’ constructions of the British countryside by illustrating the pervasiveness of ‘othering’ in rural communities, the experiences of older people with disabilities has tended to be overlooked. Drawing on the findings of a larger project in a small rural town in the south of England and carried out using semi-structured interviews, this chapter will assert that social exclusion is very much the reality of rural living for older people with disabilities. The perceptions of those older people who have aged with a disability and those who identify as having aged into a disability are discussed to illustrate the nature, extent and impact of social exclusion in the area. The chapter suggests that the impact of the problem is worsened when those older people with disabilities are associated with having a different ethnicity. This chapter concludes that racist prejudice can arise from disabled prejudice in older people in the rural context of this study; therefore, recognizing a greater appreciation of the diverse complexity of rural space, and the abandonment of singular, outdated notions of disability and age in the context of ‘rurality’ in favour of a more intersectional approach.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Growing Muslim population and internationalisation of the Halal meat industry has led to increased demand for Halal meat across the globe (Zulfakar, et al., 2018). However, most of the Halal meat is processed in the non-Muslim countries, leading to the issues of Halal transparency and fraud (Talib et al., 2015). Thus, it is imperative to identify, prioritise and mitigate Halal supply chain risks to ensure Halal integrity and supply chain continuity. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory qualitative multiple case study approach (Yin, 2018) is adopted for this research. The case companies were selected based on their major operations (sourcing, slaughtering and retailing) in the UK. The target respondents were selected based on the purposive sampling. In total, 34 semi-structured interviews were conducted with the senior management in four case companies. For the research data and the overall research quality, reliability and validity, interview data further triangulated by observations and documentary analysis. Thematic narrative analysis and social constructionism applied to analyse the collected data and report major findings. Findings: Despite the growth prospects, the UK Halal meat industry lacks collaboration and integration. The case companies found struggling due to lack of resources for growth and to sustain competitiveness against deceptive practise that exist at all tiers of their supply chains. Similarly, increasing disruptions and uncertainties has increased dependency of Halal meat retailers on their supply chain partners. Case companies identify their supply chain risks by looking at costs, collaboration, and legislation and business reputations. Case companies prioritise their supply chain risks based on costs, business reputation, and trust based relationships and in collaboration with Halal certification body. For the risk mitigation, case companies use multiple sourcing, coopetition, legal compliance, cost management and use of track and trace technologies. Our findings suggest that, none of the case companies has any formal strategy for their supply chain risk management. SCRMP were based on the senior management knowledge, experience, gut feelings, and business history. We also found that cost, margins and business reputation were main considerations at all three phases of the SCRMP within the case companies. Finally, all three institutional pressures (coercive, mimetic and normative) found in play and shaping SCRMP of case companies, however, coercive pressures (costs and laws) were main driving forces for the SCRM. Originality/Value: Prior research has focused on food supply chains with little prior research on the Halal meat industry risks, mostly in Muslim countries. Moreover, there has been no evidence of an exploratory research on the influence of institutional isomorphism and its impact on the SCRMP of UK Halal meat industry. Based on institutional theory, key risks, their identification, prioritisation and mitigation strategies explored in the context of UK Halal meat industry. The explored strategies can be used by other companies to benchmark the best practices. Research limitations: Due to the inductive, exploratory and qualitative nature, the findings of this research are only applicable to research case companies and, therefore, cannot be generalised to other companies or across the UK Halal meat industry.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

However freedom comes at a price. Cars consume natural resources and energy during manufacture and operation of the vehicle. Their emissions also pollute our city air. There are now less than 2000 UK deaths per year from road accidents yet estimates that 50,000 extra deaths have been advanced by air quality degradation. Clean alternative fuels use energy in their production or simply move pollution elsewhere. Many renewable sources consume land and have less energy density than fossil fuels.\nDifferent studies predict a doubling of the world motorcar population by 2050. During the same period peak oil is expected to be reached bringing fears of ‘energy conflict’ as nations seek to protect their oil supplies.\nCar use is becoming unsustainable. Even fuel-efficient and clean small cars weigh 1400kg and too often carry a lone 75kg occupant. Their internal combustion engines pollute at the tailpipe. Car growth has not been matched by increased road space so congestion harms the economy and quality of life leaving big cities close to gridlock. Attempts to make cars lighter for economy are militated by the need for greater occupant safety (with no benefit to pedestrians or other vulnerable road users).\nThe global automotive industry is at a challenging and exciting cusp when radical innovation is possible and indeed necessary but hurdles are not just technical. Legislation must support new approaches to design and safety but more importantly flaws inherent in human nature will have to be overcome to gain acceptance for new and sustainable approaches to personal transportation in wealthy developing countries.\nThis paper will examine critical drivers for change and propose how future designers must prepare society for imperative changes in our attitudes to personal mobility.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

However, depending on a stale/invalid route to recover from a broken link could increase the delay to recover from the broken link and degrade the network performance. In this paper, we propose a new MAC protocol (RIVC-MB) to enhance communication reliability in the multipath multichannel routing protocol. The reliability of transmitting/re-routing the data packet in multipath multichannel routing protocol is improved by providing early route invalidity detection and early switchover. Waiting time to access the medium is also improved, when a node is attempting to access a busy medium, by re-routing the data packet via the alternative route. The RIVC-MB protocol uses the cross-layer interaction between MAC and routing protocols to achieve these goals. The proposed protocol is implemented and extensively evaluated using the NS-2 simulator. Simulation results show that the new proposed protocol improves the endto- end delay, and reduces both the number of route error control packets and the number of dropped data packets in the routing layer. It also reduces reduces the collision rate in the MAC layer in a dense network.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Currently available stacks have high temperature gradients and large pressure drops across the stack, as well as uneven current distributions, contact loss and deterioration problems. An innovative stack design, dubbed \"Chessboard\", was devised at DTU Energy. The determination of the temperature, pressure and velocity fields in the stack by simulation is essential to evaluate the quality of a given design. In fact, it is not always possible to experimentally measure local physical quantities inside the stack. In this work a three-dimensional (3D) model of the stack has been constructed. L' modeling approach used is based on the homogenization technique. A computationally efficient method using simplified geometry, but with anisotropic thermophysical properties that mirror the true geometry of the stack to re-enhance the level of detail. Of all the physics describing phenomena in a SOFC, only fluid motion and heat transfer are actually solved by the model in the current stage of development, while electrochemical phenomena are defined as input parameters. Once the model was set up, a parametric study was performed, with the aim of obtaining the temperature and pressure profiles as a function of stack size, excess air, inlet air pressure and pore size . Thus identifying a safe operating window for the 4 parameters considered. The results show that it is possible to find different combinations of parameters that satisfy the design objective given by limits on the materials constituting the stack, all this with resolution times in the order of minutes.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

This later framework consists of international legal norms and institutional apparatus dealing with both the prosecution and prevention of a wide range of international crimes, beyond the four categories that are dealt with under the Rome Statute. Crimes such as specific acts of terrorism, human and drug trafficking, illicit trade in arms, corruption, and other transnational organized crimes are increasingly proscribed under various international agreements that are enforced by an international ‘executive’ institutional apparatus working with national criminal justice systems, outside of the judicial framework of international courts and tribunals. In fact, the bulk of international criminal justice activity takes place through these ‘non-judicial’ channels. Prosecutorial cooperation, extraditions, exchange of evidence, tracking and detaining of suspects and equipment across borders and so on take place routinely under the aegis of international institutional frameworks such as the INTERPOL, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes, United Nations Security Council, and regional associations of police and intelligence agencies. This international executive-led criminal justice system operates below the radar in the sense that the various expert-led international transactions that this system is anchored on do not normally attract public attention as the workings of international judicial bodies, such as the ICC, do. This paper brings to light this vast expanse of executive-led international criminal justice system that complements but operates outside the framework of international courts and tribunals. The paper then centrally presents the spill over effect of the prominent rise of international criminal law on to this executive-led international criminal justice system. Most directly, the executive-led international criminal justice system has benefited from the sweepingly permissive political environment created with the recent publicity and normative pull of international criminal law. This political climate has particularly enabled the taking of efficiency-driven build-up and reform of an international counter-crime executive system, apportioning expanded powers to national and international police and law-enforcement bodies and diminishing due process safeguards that serve to preserve rights and facilitate contestations.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Candidate pairs, as a subset of all possible pairs, are extracted based on a two-level selection process. The first-level selection uses upper-lower bounds of Bézier subcurves to remove pairs. The second-level selection is based on the spatial relationship test between a pair of Bézier curves. An iterative multidimensional Newton-Raphson method is applied on all candidate pairs in order to calculate the approximate local minimum distances. Finally, by comparing all local minimum distances between a pair of Bézier subcurves, we are able to find the global minimum distance.

As role congruity theory explains leadership skills are more ascribed to men than women resulting in prejudice existing against prospective women leaders (Eagly and Karau, 2002). Nevertheless, women having proved their efficiency and are increasingly entering leadership positions in organisations (Kark, 2004). In fact, the percentage of women in senior management teams has reached 25% in 2017 globally (IBR, 2017), showing an increase of 3% since 2015 (IBR, 2015), however, the concern lies in the fact that the number of organisations with no woman at a senior level position has increased from 32% in 2015 to 34% in 2017. Norton (2005) discussed about Friedan’s argument that restricting a woman to the confines of her household limited her opportunities and was a waste of potential talent. The movement of feminism attempted to provide independence that gave a voice to women’s gender as unique and different from men suggesting that men and women are two distinct groups of people who think, communicate, influence, and lead in different ways (McCann, 2008). The irony is women still face glass ceiling in the workplace today. Leadership is influenced by masculine characteristics (Olsson, 2000) whilst Helgesen (1995) and Rosener (1995) debated that women’s leadership style is unique and differs from men’s leadership. Women tend to enhance social connections through conversations and building relationships whilst men are more inclined to use language to exert dominance, maintain status, and achieve tangible outcomes (Leaper, 1991; Mason, 1994; Wood, 1996; Manwa, 2002; Schein 2007; Zenger et al., 2011). The gender differences have always been visible in behaviours of men and women. While women are assumed to be overall more expressive, tentative, and polite in conversations, men have been more commonly associated with traits such as assertive and power hungry (Basow and Rubenfield, 2003). Contrarily, Eagly and Carli (2007) proposed that women may find difficulties in pursuing leadership positions and may be forced to adopt agentic or masculine behaviours; or they are forced to adopt such styles that convinces the others of their power and effectiveness (Catalyst, 2005). In this context, with regard to relatively unexplored area (Mowbray et al., 2015), this study intends to answer crucial questions: - (1) Do women leaders influence employee voice in their women followers or perpetuate gender stereotyping in organisations? (2) How women leaders influence employee voice in their women followers and the role of HR interventions in organisations. The paper goes beyond previous literature reviews on gender stereotyping or leadership and employee voice by critically reviewing existing literature to find the positive or negative influence of women leaders on employee voice of women followers. Through adopting our critical, gender perspective, as well as our application of a followership lens, we explore power differences within interactions between women leaders and their followers. We focus on the agentic practice of employee voice, a “broad and complex construct” (Gao, Janssen and Shi, 2011, p.788), to consider the presence of domination, oppression and exclusion. The paper will endeavour to provide a conceptual model of research through review of existing literature and an agenda for future research.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

This realisation led to the first international Drawing Conversations Symposium, accompanied by the Drawn Conversations Exhibition at Coventry University, UK, in December 2015. The two events drew a strong and global response, and brought together a wide range of participants, including academics, artists, researchers, designers, architects and doctoral students. This book considers what happens, and how, when people draw together either in the form of a collaboration, or through a collective process. The contributions here serve to establish the field of collective and collaborative drawing as distinct from the types of drawing undertaken by artists, designers, and architects within a professional context. The volume covers conversations through the act of drawing, collaborative drawing, drawing communities, and alternative drawing collaborations.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

This trend will occur whether designers, and others, like it or not. Some consumers are already able to design and manufacture their own products. However, these tend to look rather amateurish and not like finished “industrial designs”. This is where professional designers will still have a role to play. In AM-enabled consumer design, the role of designers will be to design deliberately unfinished objects. This is already happening to a limited extent. In “mass customisation” consumers are presented with an unfinished product and invited to follow their wishes and opinions to create a unique object. When considering mass customisation as an example of consumer design, it could be said that this is configuration, not design. Choosing from a menu of existing options does not make someone a designer. What is not possible, within a mass customisation scenario, is the ability to actually change the shape of the product, to affect the size or geometry. Recent work at Loughborough University, and elsewhere, shows how consumer design can be taken beyond mass customisation. Consumers can be presented with one example of a product design and allowed to change its shape and dimensions. Alternatively, they can be provided with a basic shape and allowed to create additional features to complete the design. To achieve this, new types of CAD software are required, referred to here as “easy CAD”. A number of alternative strategies exist and are being evaluated. Results so far indicate that consumers are able to create unique designs if they are enabled and guided by the right tools. The key element is to remove the fear of creating a “bad” design. Consumers need to be given the confidence to know that a product they have designed themselves will not break or be dangerous, basically that it is going to work.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Demand for traditional foods is growing as customers associate them with quality and a return to tradition (Banterle et al, 2008; Banterle and Carresesi, 2007; O’Reilly and Haines, 2004). However, to fully capitalize on the opportunities available, Heathfield (1997, cited in Banterle et al, 2008) argues that SME could use their flexibility and agility to orient their strategies towards the marketplace, focusing less on the product in order to take fuller advantage of the opportunities that arise. Whilst this might be a more attractive proposition to some traditional food producers (TFP) than others, firms can respond differently to the opportunities that they perceive, exploiting their individual resources and capabilities in the development of strategy. This supports growth, based on their resources and capabilities, and encourages heterogeneity in the sector (Carraresi et al, 2011:2).  The call, in essence, is for the traditional food producing SME to be more entrepreneurial and innovative in all aspects of their business model design (Stewart and Lockyer, 2014). The production and sale of traditional foods is seen as critical to the economic wellbeing of many regions and Europe aims to establish systems to protect registered traditional foods in order to give local produc-ers a framework to produce high quality regional products (European Commission, 2007a). However, the European Commission also believes that by improving the competitiveness and market reach of these products, they will become more sustainable and contribute more effectively to the Lisbon Strategy for increased growth, employment and social welfare (Dale, 2010: 8).  To achieve this, the Commission aims to support Member States to modernise their education system to develop a more innovative workforce. The idea of promoting a ‘Europe of Knowledge’ was first proclaimed by the European Commission in 1997 (Dale, 2010:3).  Through the Europe of Knowledge (KoE), wealth creation would be linked to the production and dissemination of knowledge.   The belief is that Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in Europe have yet to fulfill their role in society in that their potential contribution to Europe’s prosperity is underexploited (Kwiek and Kurkiewicz, 2012:249). It is argued that stronger links between education, research and business could more effectively contribute to jobs, growth and to the exploitation of marketable products and services (ibid: 255). This paper will bring together three key concepts: entrepreneurship, research / education and the competi-tiveness of traditional food producing SMEs. It will present the postgraduate Entrepreneurship Summer Academy (ESA) designed and delivered by the entrepreneurship team of TRADEIT  - Traditional Food, Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Technology an FP7 funded project THEME [KBBE 2013.2.2-02] as a model of best practice in entrepreneurial learning.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

It also affirms the upside of human factors in aviation - the positive contribution that it can make to the industry - and avoids placing undue emphasis on when the human component fails. The book is divided into four main parts. Part one describes the underpinning science base, with chapters on human information processing, workload, situation awareness, decision making, error and individual differences. Part two of the book looks at the human in the system, containing chapters on pilot selection, simulation and training, stress, fatigue and alcohol, and environmental stressors. Part three takes a closer look at the machine (the aircraft), beginning with an examination of flight deck display design, followed by chapters on aircraft control, flight deck automation, and HCI on the flight deck. Part four completes the volume with a consideration of safety management issues, both on the flight deck and across the airline; the final chapter in this section looks at human factors for incident and accident investigation.

Data show that the lack of effectiveness of some acaricides is spreading in Europe and call for the adoption of alternative management strategies to avoid development of resistance.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The Rio+20 UN conference specifically drew attention to the green economy approach in the context of sustainable development to move away from business-as-usual practices, act to end poverty, address environmental destruction and build a bridge to the sustainable future. It is increasingly recognized that the tourism sector can make a major contribution to the green economy through more sustainable practices, climate change mitigation and ecotourism. The role of tourism sector will continue to be crucial in the post-2015 sustainable development agenda too. However, there are ambiguities about how tourism and allied industries can maximize their contribution to human well-being and ensure environmentally sustainability, embracing issues of political economy, geography and business ethics.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Owing to the hyper active nature of the market place, the pace of change has never been greater than in the current business environment and is becoming a constant feature of organisational life. Coupled with massive economic expansion, increased globalisation and massive transnational flow of information, there is colossal pressure on public sector organisations to relentlessly instigate change. This paper focuses on one such change, the establishment of an automated road tolling system wherein the organisation (roads and traffic agency) is faced with the task of resolving the traffic woes of the city of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and is working towards the integration of the entire road and transport network. The aim of this paper is to examine ways of improving the effectiveness of public sector organisations to manage change. This was explored by investigating how the road and traffic agency is managing change, especially change related to the implementation of advanced technology, evaluate the consequences of this change on the existing network and stakeholders and to appraise the management strategy deployed to address the transport network. The findings of this paper indicate key emerging issues adversely impacting the change approach deployed. These include prioritisation issues, timing of the change activities, time allotted to the change activities and issues pertaining to monitoring and feedback of change.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Im Gegenteil, die Austragung von Konflikten, jedoch nicht im absoluten Schmittschen Sinne, war für Morgenthau Grundlage für die Aufrechterhaltung des politischen Raumes; für Morgenthau die Basis für Demokratien. Durch seine Erfahrungen in der Weimarer Republik fürchtete Morgenthau die sukzessive Abschaffung dieses Raumes durch eine fortschreitende Ideologisierung, Technologisierung und Szientifizierung. Um dieser Entwicklung entgegenzutreten, trat Morgenthau für eine Tugendlehre für Politiker ein und sah Wissenschaftler in der Pflicht, sich in einem mäeutischen Prozess kritisch an der Aufrechterhaltung des Politischen zu beteiligen. Hans Morgenthau’s concept of the political is a relatively little addressed, though being central to his thought. Even before his emigration to the United States, he critically engaged with Carl Schmitt’s conceptualisation, arguing that not all conflicts can or have to be solved through jurisdiction. Rather, conflicts, but not in the absolute Schmittian sense, were for Morgenthau the fundament for the perpetuation of the political realm; a realm which Morgenthau considered to be the basis of democracies. However, due to his Weimar experiences, Morgenthau saw the political in danger and aimed to confront this rising depoliticisation. In order to do so, Morgenthau promoted an ethics of responsibility for politicians and considered it the duty of scholars to critically accompany this process of repoliticisation through a maieutic process.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

In addition, the study explored gender differences in sensitivity to the effects of visual appearance and perceived comfort. The results showed that the visual appearance of physically identical seats had a large and statistically significant effect on perceived comfort. Furthermore, the effect of visual appearance on perceived comfort was found to be considerably larger for female participants.

The wettability characteristics of the nylon 6,6 were modified by generating a number of patterns of various topography on the surface using the CO 2 laser. Thereafter the as-received and modified surfaces were analysed using white light interferometry to quantify the topographical changes. Any changes in the chemical composition of the surfaces were explored with EDX and XPS analysis. To quantify the wettability characteristics as a function of laser irradiation, contact angles where determined using a sessile drop device for each sample. In this way it was possible to determine the efficacy of the CO 2 laser generated topographical patterns in terms of wettability characteristics modification. It has been proposed that the increase in contact angle for the laser irradiated samples is due to a change in wetting regime from Wenzel to Cassie-Baxter.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

For instance, some studies report on the use of derivatives by nonfinancial firms. Yet, another group of researchers has investigated the determinants of corporate hedging policies. These and other studies of similar focus have made important contributions to the literature. This study sheds light on derivatives usage in the UK market. This paper presents the results of a questionnaire survey, which focused on determining the reasons for using or not using derivatives for 401 UK nonfinancial companies. The results indicate that (i) larger firms are more likely to use derivatives than medium and smaller firms, (ii) public companies are more likely to use derivatives than private firms, and (iii) derivatives usage is greatest among international firms. The results also show that, of firms not using derivatives, half of firms do not use these derivative instruments because their exposures are not significant and that the most important reasons they do not use derivatives are: concerns about disclosures of derivatives activity required under FASB rules, and costs of establishing and maintaining derivatives programmes exceed the expected benefits. The results show that foreign exchange risk is the risk most commonly managed with derivatives and interest rate risk is the next most commonly managed risk. The results also indicate that the most important reason for using hedging with derivatives is managing the volatility in cash flows.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

One such issue is the importance of women’s healthcare in the Middle East. In a region of the world where personal modesty often takes precedent over appropriate healthcare being sought, the global recognition of the importance of early diagnosis of breast cancer being important in its effective treatment is having an impact on how the global community addresses regional customs in the case of globally relevant issues. Despite significant medical advances in the management of breast cancer, there remain many barriers which are limiting the ability to further develop early diagnosis and treatment of the disease from a global perspective. An earlier case-based study had drawn attention to social and cultural difficulties in the healthcare system within a Middle Eastern diaspora particularly due to delays in early detection and timely treatment of breast cancer. Following the identi- fication of the main causes underlying delays in breast cancer detection, corrective measures to establish an efficient management system enabled the transformation of societal and cultural disadvantages into opportunities for positive change. Consequently, in an effort to minimise delays and reduce rising mortality figures in the Arab World, a breast cancer man- agement plan was proposed. This paper thus addresses the process to introduce much needed improvement in the healthcare industry in the Arab World, by examining breast cancer management in the region, with a focus on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a potential model for change in the broader Middle East and Islamic World.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

This work details the characteristics and feasibility of a technique to remove industrial epoxy grout using a 120W HPDL. The highest removal rate was achieved with an O2 process gas owing to the high reactive nature of the gas. A threshold power density of approximately 300 W/cm2 was found to exist below which removal did not occur. Furthermore, the minimum interaction time, below which there was no removal of epoxy tile grout, was found to be approximately 0.5 s. The maximum theoretical removal rate that may be achievable using the HPDL was calculated as being 66 mm2/s. A microstructural analysis revealed significant differences in the epoxy grout surface structure before and after the HPDL radiation. The surface of the HPDL-treated samples exhibited a collection of grouped particles with pores and gaps, whereas the untreated samples displayed a continuous monostructured plane surface. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses revealed changes in the chemical composition of the epoxy grout after the HPDL radiation. In particular, CaO and CO2 were found in the HPDL treated samples resulting from decomposition of CaCO3 (limestone). In addition, SiO2 that existed in the un-treated epoxy grout material was not detected after HPDL processing due to the compound verification. A thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) identified a sequence of thermal history for the epoxy grout which therefore allowed the prediction of the reactions that occur in the epoxy grout due to HPDL interaction.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Through consideration of Rouget’s (1985) definitions of ecstasy and trance, I will discuss the relationship of psy-trance culture to Rouget’s definition of trance. From this position I shall then propose the use of electroacoustic music in relation to Rouget’s definition of ecstasy. This will enable me to define ‘shamanic diffusions’ as an opposing technoshamanic approach to that which is used in psy-trance. Under this discussion, electroacoustic music will be considered as an ecstatic technology. I shall then conclude with some comments and speculation regarding how this concept may be useful as an approach for the composition and performance of electroacoustic music. For example, in various composed works I have used altered states of consciousness and hallucinations, as a principle for the design of sonic materials and musical structure.

This thesis explores how we might consider this question theoretically while engaging with it empirically. In engaging with this theoretically I read insights from Boje’s storytelling theory and Barads agential realism paradigm through one another. Framed within an agential realism paradigm, this study employs a qualitative, post-humanist approach that considers storytelling as a material-discursive practice co-constituted by humans and non-humans, and explores how learning is enacted within storytelling practices. The empirical material with which to think from and with this question was mainly drawn from 58 conversations enacted over a threeyear engagement with 9 M&A practitioners located across 5 different countries and several tools used in their day to day M&A practices. These practitioners were undergoing changes to their core tasks and work processes. The conversations with the practitioners were enacted mainly through Skype and Zoom. In addition to the more formal conversations, the study draws on conversations with practitioners via WhatsApp chat and email exchanges. This thesis tells a number of entangled stories, and explores how dis/continuous learning is enacted within the storytelling practices of M&A managers and how this learning enables changes to their existing organisational M&A practices. In particular it examines how embodied storytelling informs and guides how actors approach learning. The literature review examines prior publications in the field of M&As from both functionalist and interpretivist paradigm. The research account tells stories about production of learning within conventional narrative apparatus, living story apparatus and intraview apparatus. The study explores how different apparatuses allow different opportunities for learning, therefore learning is about response-ability, becoming attuned to agential cutting as they occur within storytelling practices. In the discussion chapter, insights from the storytelling of M&A scholars, M&A practitioners and the researcher are then read through one another. The primary contribution of the thesis is methodological, as it provides an in-depth longitudinal exploration of the process of dis/continuous learning within M&As, thus addressing the limited presence of storytelling perspectives of learning in M&As. Additionally, the thesis advances an 4 ontoepistemological approach to investigating storytelling and learning. Drawing on insights from quantum physics this study illustrates that storytelling occurs through diffraction and learning is about bodymind attunement to agential cutting as they occur within day to day practices. The study argues for the significance of space, time and matter-ing to learning, and the need for practitioners to become more attuned to the affective flows between human and non-humans within their day to day practices. More generally, the thesis has argued for the value of material-discursive storytelling for understanding how managers learn during complex events, while identifying limitations to conventional narrative, living story and intraview apparatuses for the production of learning.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

We draw attention to how HEIs have a vital role to play in developing students' temporal awareness. Developing temporal awareness is one of the key challenges for universities and is still a relatively undefined concept. Previous work that describes the nature of entrepreneurship within a multi-time-period framework provides a conceptual grounding for exploring the temporal dynamics of the entrepreneurial process. In fact, there is literature that suggests that the futurity that entrepreneurship must confront introduces the possibility that the entrepreneur may, by his own creative actions, construct the future as he or she wishes it to be. We surmise that creating and developing new venture ideas within HEI incubators provides an opportunity to develop temporal awareness through temporal imagination and the projection of probable and possible future trajectories of action. We explore these temporal practices using material gathered through a longitudinal study of four student entrepreneurs in a university incubator. The case studies were constructed from real time and retrospective data, typically by interviewing the lead potential entrepreneur. The study confirmed that HEI's are key institutions for cultivating students' temporal imagination. This has practical relevance for university-based entrepreneurship. If HEIs are to have more prominent roles in entrepreneurship education, new interventions are required to generate and develop venture ideas.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

One was given by the art theorist and writer Carl Einstein. Einstein’s contribution has been the subject of some confusion. The contemporary reports of the event named Carl Einstein using only his surname, leading many commentators to assume that the ‘Einstein’ of the reports was the physicist Albert Einstein.

Through the multiple substitutions of Carl Einstein – a practice that Einstein pursued throughout his life – the themes of masked subjectivity, mistaken identities, of persons that are substituted after the event, of orations, speeches, and texts rewritten, speculated upon and redelivered that celebrate, map and fictionalise a past life are explored in this book.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Moreover, a high- (vs. low-) level construal triggered greater ingroup bias for Koreans (Experiment 2) and Australians (Experiment 3) primed with a relational self, but not for those primed with an independent self. This construal level effect on ingroup bias was eliminated when belongingness was primed at both a high- and a low-level construal; instead, relationals under a low-level construal were more ingroup-biased when they were primed with a belongingness (vs. baseline) condition (Experiment 4).

Fitting banks’ P/L data to alternative VaR models, we find that the Historical Simulation and GARCH-type models with Gaussian innovation can provide more accurate VaR figures under normal market conditions. During crisis period, the GARCH-type models with Student t assumption are superior. The Extreme Value Theory approach, which was shown to be powerful in estimating VaR in recent financial crises, performs poorly when applying to the actual banks’ data. We conclude that good VaR estimates can be obtained using simple, accessible models rather than complicated parametric methods or banks’ internal VaR models. Thus, the blame for misleading VaR estimates during financial crisis should not be cast upon the mathematical techniques, but simply depends on the choice of VaR models.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

It employs the empirical example of the evolution of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in South Korea between 1910 and 2013 to investigate the role of the cognitive dimension of the national institution play in the local adoption of globally theorized ideas. More specifically, the study reveals distinct patterns in rhetorical CSR evolution from the social expectation from the wealthy towards the Anglo-American notion of explicit CSR by focusing on the cultural system of the Korean national business system--how people perceive and expect wealth and the role of the wealthy, corporations, and chaebols (the Korean business clans) in the history of the Korean business system towards the neo-liberal market transformation. Conceptually, this research aims at highlighting the dynamic view on the national business system approach, which had been regarded as a unique and static institutional frame, embedded into a given nation, and in particular relates the role of the cognitive dimension of the national business system to mechanisms and processes of institutional change.

Each neighbourhood has their own gems, whether they are rogue or hidden, or even long forgotten, run down or demolished. We must remember that people have connections to buildings and that buildings have served in a different capacity in the past, then may have been left to step back to make way for the new and the bigger, the bolder or economically or politically more viable architecture and infrastructure. Whilst many buildings have been demolished and replaced by new schemes, many remain on death row awaiting demolition, or if lucky; a new future, a new purpose, a total repair and reinvention. Industrial buildings can be particularly challenging, however many rewarding and successful projects are derived from the original use of buildings and their heritage. Industrial buildings are particularly interesting due to their robustness and large open plan spaces, inviting opportunities. In this essay, I discuss some of these projects; industrial buildings that are reinvented for new use, whilst respectfully celebrating their architectural and industrial heritage.

Between the spaces created by the staggered aluminum structures, five miniature, white paintings are motorized, programmed and choreographed to appear, disappear, reverse and re-appear like the musical structure of a fugue.

In other words, Granier took the sounds derived from a painting and turned them into a fugue. Or, put yet another way, Granier took a painting’s typically inaudible voice (made audible for Delay) and set it to music, which in turn inspired the mechanical opera The Fugue. Completing all this is a black mirror, off to one side, that reflects the miniature set-up, referencing the work’s ever-changing context and the poignant reality that things (and people) are doomed to change– are continuously in a state of flux, morphing, challenging and altering us.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The main topics drawn upon in this conceptual paper are literature surrounding entrepreneurship, entrepreneurship education, UK government entrepreneurship policies, ethnic minority entrepreneurship, disadvantaged groups and female entrepreneurship, to provide context. Finally, the following research outcome anticipated from examining of this scholarly literature is to form a framework for the undertaking of further research into how a housing association could foster a culture of entrepreneurship among their long-term unemployed female tenants, as a path to employment, in Balsall Heath, Birmingham. ‘Today, the term entrepreneur is no longer dominated by males’ (Narayanasamy et al., 2011:17). Thus the long standing debate between male entrepreneurship and female entrepreneurship exists, about the gender dominance in this discipline. Marlow argues that entrepreneurship is masculinised suggesting that it is dominated by male researchers and writers such as Schumpeter, Kirzner and Knight (1996). In contrast to this, female entrepreneurship is made up of feminist discussions (Marlow 1996, 2006; Pardo-del-Val, 2010), however it could be suggested that entrepreneurship is masculinised therefore female entrepreneurship endeavours to break away from the typical male entrepreneur stereotype. Additionally, this may be a response to a large portion of research within female entrepreneurship that personifies or highlights others personifying female entrepreneurs in a rather negative light (Marlow et al., 2009; Narayanasamy et al., 2011; Okafor, 2010; Patterson et al., 2012; Sexton and Bownman-Upton, 1990). The field of entrepreneurship and within that female entrepreneurship is incredibly complex as Brazeal and Herbert acknowledge suggesting that entrepreneurship is a ‘perplexing discipline’ due to the various perspectives within this large field, adding to the complexity in understanding entrepreneurship (1999). Research into ethnic minority entrepreneurship highlights similar issues faced by women, with ethnic minority entrepreneurs experiencing additional hurdles such as race, religion, culture and family ties (Clark and Drinkwater, 2000; Fadahunsi et al., 2000; Heilman and Chen, 2003; Ahl, 2006; Kwong et al., 2009). Similarities to female entrepreneurship include lower paid jobs, difficulty in career advancement and of course gender (Heilman and Chen, 2003; Ahl, 2006; Verduijn and Essers, 2013). Yet unlike female entrepreneurship ethnic minorities seem to be presented more positively, through the number of positive aspects to ethnic minority entrepreneurship, some examples include deeming their success to hard work embedded through culture and tight knitted family structures who also play much involvement within the ethnic minority entrepreneurs enterprise but also the involvement through hiring and support of other ethnic minorities (McEvoy and Hafeez, 2009); Another key aspect in ethnic minorities is the action of practice based learning, many ethnic minority entrepreneurs are cultivated through learning from an existing ethnic minority entrepreneur before venturing into the creation of their own enterprise (Aldrich and Waldinger, 1990). A similar conflict, to the masculinisation of entrepreneurship, has been identified within entrepreneurship education, of this discipline being gendered (Pathak et al., 2013), specifically that the language used within entrepreneurship education is masculine and stereotyped (Jones, 2010). Further debates include much research suggesting that the pedagogies used within entrepreneurship education are unsuitable, and that they need to be re-evaluated in order to reflect real world preparation for students (Higgins et al., 2013) which ties in well with Rae’s practice-based theory (2004b). As with entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship education, UK government entrepreneurship policy could also be argued to be masculinised through its policies, and that this is through the influences of the male dominated and gendered disciplines of entrepreneurship and education (Jones, 2012). Due to this, policies have resulted in providing inadequate support and realistically unmeasurable for female and ethnic minority entrepreneurship (Marlow, 2006; Fadahunsi et al., 2000, Thompson et al., 2009; Pardo-del-Val, 2010; Hyitti and O'Gorman, 2004). The current and key entrepreneurial government policy examined in this paper is the New Enterprise Allowance. The New Enterprise Allowance is available to the unemployed and wishing to set up their own enterprise, who are given an allowance to do this. Marlow opinions that current policies are scrutinising towards this group of individuals (2006), whilst lack of networks and relationships, and work experience and qualifications are the main hindrances for such a group of individuals (Bull and Willard, 2003; Aldrich and Martinez, 2001; Marlow, 2006). The critical analysis of the literature reviewed can be summarised as: highlighting an emerging recognition that existent entrepreneurship theories may not be useable for practical application within all entrepreneurship working environments (Higgins et al., 2013; Rae, 2004b; Zahra, 2007). The contribution to knowledge identifies a paucity of applicable entrepreneurship theories and sets a basis for significant theory generation within a practical environment, for female entrepreneurs, applicable to the entrepreneur (Rae, 2004b). As entrepreneurs utilise informal approaches that are pragmatic solutions appropriate to themselves and which are sense-making to them via their own personal encounters (Higgins et al., 2013), they are often more than not sceptical to reach out to theoretical hypothesises. Possibly the incentive that researchers themselves contest that plausible theory is deficient within the entrepreneurship (Phan, 2004; Zahra, 2005) is moderately why entrepreneurs are swift to reject academic theory. Finally, it is predetermined that the outcome of future research necessitates to have a practical legitimacy, as much as theoretical, to be able to achieve the purpose of women and ethnic minorities utilising entrepreneurship as a path to employment.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Organisations will have a mandatory obligation to report breaches of personal data, and will face fines of up to 4% of global turnover – or €20 million (approximately £17.3 million) – whichever is the greater. Victims of personal data breach will have the right to judicial remedy, and compensation limits are uncapped. Faced with such deterrents, organisations will need to ensure they are fully ready for the GDPR’s arrival, yet they now have less than 12 months to become compliant. In data protection terms, this is a seismic event. This paper aims to examine corporate GDPR readiness, with focus on how digital forensic process can help with data breach investigations, mindful that organisations may be less able to defend themselves in legal proceedings if the evidence they present has not been acquired reliably. For the purposes of this research, scope was limited to organisations in the UK, to avoid complications of legal jurisdiction and sovereignty boundaries, and because of topical uncertainty caused by the UK’s 2016 referendum decision to leave the EU. The author’s previous experience in corporate IT environments led to a natural curiosity of how well IT departments are preparing for the GDPR. Research was quantitative in nature and adopted the critical research method. Primary research included an online survey, completed anonymously by 145 IT workers, which aimed to gauge organisations’ levels of maturity regarding data protection and forensic investigation. Results were critically analysed and compared to existing research where available, and to the author’s own theoretical assumptions. Findings suggest that most organisations are significantly under-prepared for the GDPR and that workplace investigations of suspected computer misuse are predominantly undertaken by IT staff who lack basic awareness of digital forensic principles and data protection.

Occupants (staff, patients, visitors) have a unique experience of the design of the spaces and have a valued opinion to be captured. Design methods have a part to play in translating this experiential understanding of clinical environments into concepts that designers understand (see Bate and Roberts, 2000). Objective: This paper reports on a multidisciplinary research programme aiming to understand the importance of stakeholder participation in healthcare environment design. The essence of the research was to use design research method and design thinking in clinical environments with non- designers to create effective dialogues that create positive healthcare spaces. These methods are the focus of this paper reporting the results from three case studies in the UK including the redesign of an emergency department, the design of a bespoke wellbeing centre and staff feedback on design characteristics of a general practice health centre. Methods: Methods ranged from design workshops (including sketching and 3D modelling), digital situated crowdsourcing, interviews, stress walks and questionnaires to gather insights into each case study. 145 users consisting of staff, patients and visitors took part the in the research. Results: Despite nuances in the research question of each case study the methods proved successful in gathering experiential insights into the design of each space. Workshops, interviews and questionnaires enabled effective communication of stakeholder’s views drawing upon natural dialogue whilst using activities to facilitate creative thinking. More novel approaches such as ‘stress walks’ to discover environmental attributes causing stress were equally effective and enabled the contextual elements of space to be appraised first hand. Using digital technology via a bespoke situated crowdsourcing tablet computer offers opportunities for future participation to be made feasible due to benefits of perceived informality and security. Importantly using these approaches enabled designers to interpret research findings to inform initial design concepts of positive healthcare environments in an iterative process. Conclusions: The programme highlights the importance of participation in terms of drawing on the experiential understanding of stakeholder groups in developing positive healthcare environments. Challenges remain particularly in correlating the process of participation to objective measures of recovery, for example, to provide weight to the importance of participation. These future challenges and opportunities provide an exciting future research agenda in an effort to deliver positive healthcare spaces.

Despite theoretical assumptions, there is little published research on work engagement, due primarily to its recent emergence as a psychological construct. Furthermore, examining work engagement among high-stress occupations, such as police, is useful because police officers are generally characterized as having a high level of work engagement. Previous research has identified job resources (e.g. social support) as antecedents of work engagement. However detailed evaluation of job demands as an antecedent of work engagement within high-stress occupations has been scarce. Thus our second aim was to test job demands (i.e. monitoring demands and problem-solving demands) and job resources (i.e. time control, method control, supervisory support, colleague support, and friend and family support) as antecedents of work engagement among police officers. Method: Data were collected via a self-report online survey from one Australian state police service (n = 1,419). Due to the high number of hypothesized antecedent variables, hierarchical multiple regression analysis was employed rather than structural equation modelling. Results: Work engagement reported by police officers was high. Female officers had significantly higher levels of work engagement than male officers, while officers at mid-level ranks (sergeant) reported the lowest levels of work engagement. Job resources (method control, supervisor support and colleague support) were significant antecedents of three dimensions of work engagement. Only monitoring demands were significant antecedent of the absorption. Conclusion: Having healthy and engaged police officers is important for community security and economic growth. This study identified some common factors which influence work engagement experienced by police officers. However, we also note that excessive work engagement can yield negative outcomes such as psychological distress.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Knowledge of an additional language might indicate reliance on different spelling processes. It might be expected that phonological ability would be more strongly associated with spelling performance in EAL children due to awareness of a more transparent language than English. It might also be expected that children with spelling difficulties might use different spelling skills in comparison to the two groups with no spelling difficulties.\n\nMethods: Research into spelling is sparse. Thus, participants (N=217, age range from 7 to 10 years, recruited from schools in the UK), were assessed with a standardised single word spelling test (WIAT-II, Wechsler 2005). They were also assessed in phonological ability, rapid digit naming, visual attention span, visual memory and two tasks of print exposure. One-way ANOVA and correlational analyses were conducted to investigate associations and to compare performance.\n\nFindings: We found that EAL groups performed significantly lower in print exposure tasks in comparison to English-only typical spellers (tEALtypical(144)=6.67, p<.001, r=.49 & tEALatypical(144)=4.38, p<.001, r=.34) but not differently to English-only atypical spellers (p>.05, respectively).\n\nDiscussion: These findings demonstrate the importance of appropriate interventions for bilingual children targeting if possible both languages and with selection of appropriate stimuli for spelling support. Thus, we also discuss the importance of developing psycholinguistic databases for bilingual children like BiLex-Kids, a database we developed for bilingual children learning Greek as a second language.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

For Speed, the queen was a formidable female presence, authoritative, ready to measure any place or person. The atlas, finished during James' reign, later omitted her picture. But this disappearance did not mean Elizabeth vanished entirely; her image and her connection to geography appear in multiple plays and maps. Elizabeth becomes, like the ruler she holds, an instrument applied and adapted. Women and Geography on the Early Modern English Stage explores the ways in which mapmakers, playwrights, and audiences in early modern England could, following their queen's example, use the ideas of geography, or 'world-writing', to reshape the symbolic import of the female body and territory to create new identities.

We examine Rio’s 2016 Olympic event spaces to investigate such spatial and economic effects. Empirical, qualitative insights are generated through real-time observation, photo and video diaries capturing visitor flows, engagements and consumption with (or not) local entrepreneurs across three official Olympic zones: Copacabana beach, Olympic Boulevard in Porto Maravilha, and Olympic Stadium in Maracanã. Furthermore, we draw on 17 interviews with governmental, non-governmental, and senior tourism industry actors to corroborate real-time analysis. Contrary to previous research, our findings reveal how Rio’s event zones represented a disruption in global-corporate consumption and logic – offering a balanced platform for both global businesses and local entrepreneurs to leverage mega-event visitor economies. We conceptualise these spaces as both ‘liminal’ and ‘liminoidal’ – generating a unique transitional dwelling space across ‘transit zones’ to and from event venue seldom found in other mega-sport event contexts.

Immediately pre- and post-training, participants completed a tourniquet test to\nexamine ischaemic muscle pain tolerance and two time to exhaustion (TTE) trials at 50%Δ to examine exercise tolerance; the post-training TTE trials were completed at the\npre-training 50%Δ (same absolute intensity) and the post-training 50%Δ (same relative intensity).\nRESULTS: HIIT and CONT resulted in similar improvements in all markers of aerobic fitness (P>0.05). Compared with pre-training, HIIT increased TTE at the same absolute\nand relative intensity as pre-training (148% and 43%, respectively) to a greater extent than CONT (38% and -4%, respectively) (P<0.05). HIIT increased pain tolerance (41%,\nP<0.001), which demonstrated moderate non-significant associations with the increase in TTE at the same relative intensity as pre-training (r=0.50, P=0.07), however pain\ntolerance was unaffected by CONT (-3%, P>0.05).\nCONCLUSION: The repeated exposure to a high-intensity noxious exercise training stimuli increases ischemic muscle pain tolerance, which is independent of the\nimprovements in aerobic fitness induced by endurance training. This increase in ischemic muscle pain tolerance may be an important contributor to the increase in highintensity\nexercise tolerance following HIIT.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Theodora Jankowski in Pure Resistance: Queer Virginity in Early Modern English Drama explains how oftentimes in a union where the woman had not been previously wed, the bride's importance lay in her virginity; her husband's appropriation of her maidenhead often solidified the marriage through consummation that assured both famines that their property would be inherited by legitimate heirs.

Many managers speak of ‘putting on an act’ or hiding their true thoughts from those around them at work (Fried-Buchalter, 1997). Using the work of Goffman (1959), Ecclestone (2007) and Bimrose and Brown (2010), this paper explores the self-identity of a group of twenty managers in the sector who have made the transition from lecturer to manager. Using semi-structured questionnaires and a thematic analysis of results, the research concluded that many of the managers overcame the pressures of their new role by establishing a philosophical driver that could be defined as a set of values, beliefs and personal goals that influenced all decision made as a manager.

The following section explores characteristics of youth, or young people, that make them particularly suited to some forms of hospitality work, and thereby a talent to be recruited and managed. The final section seeks to better understand the work values, broadly defined, of today’s youth, which may arguably assist in their recruitment and retention, as well as their management. It should be noted from the outset that this line of investigation, i.e. a focus on youth attributes and their relationship to the hospitality firm, is fairly novel and as such the discussion is necessarily theoretical in the main for want of empirical evidence.

The discussions emphasize the significance of urban tourism within debates upon the contemporary city, postmodernity and the pursuit of social science. Clearly written, with case studies and further reading, this book should be welcomed by students and lecturers in geography, tourism, planning and sociology", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

However, this becomes challenging when investigating fault alarms that cannot be verified, diagnosed or even duplicated under standard manual inspection regimes. To improve system effectiveness, it is essential to investigate these instances, along with the effects of design parameters on system dynamic characteristics. Recent research has identified intermittent fault behaviour within components as one of the primary focuses for false alarms, and hence a direct consequence to the phenomenon of 'no fault found'. This paper examines the performance characteristics of an electronic system under intermittent component variations. Understanding occurrences in parameter deviations (and their impact) can help with understanding the requirements for improving system fault tolerance. It is shown that, in many cases of practical importance, components do not have the same sensitivity to intermittent variations and hence can be better suited for monitoring. The analysis provides extra information and guidance for the maintenance decision-making process in organisations on resource requirements.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

While the security implications are diverse, and the doctrine is divided about the consequences in term of likelihood of conflicts, it has resulted in increased international tensions on strategic materials. China is at the very centre of this scramble, and there is quite an amount of attention devoted to China’s economic growth as well as its possible imperialistic aspirations in today’s world. This article explores resource-seeking Chinese corporations, especially the ones involved in the oil business, and the consequences in term of security issues at a geopolitical level. While the duality conflict / cooperation is taken into account, this research focuses on oil corporations from China and India, which aggressively try to secure markets and resources. They generally compete against MNCs both from the OECD countries and from other emerging players. In order to illustrate the challenges this phenomenon involves, the analysis will use a specific case-study, PetroChina (and its parent CNOOC), showing the way they are involved in acquisition of resources abroad and how this has put them on a collision route with ONGC and ONGC Videsh Ltd, Indian companies involved in the same activity. Finally, it will look at the rivalry between India and China in economic and geopolitical terms as well within the context of broader global economic issues.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

This paper is aimed at main drivers and barriers for the implementation of PAR within the field of Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC). A review of the literature was performed highlighting the main barriers and drivers for the implementation of PAR in the AEC sector, as well as possible applications of this technology. The literature review showed cost of technology, hardware issues and development of applications as the main barriers for implementing PAR. Whereas, error and cost reduction; and continued assistance were the main drivers of implementation. Although there are some barriers to overcome, the future implementation of PAR in the construction sector looks promising with possible applications of this technology in the AEC sector such as visualisation of spatial, drawing or technical information for designers, the jobsite workforce or marketing purposes.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

I created this artwork for the Espasado collective exhibition at the Palacio de Moctezuma (Archivo Histórico Provincial de Cáceres, Regional Government of Extremadura, Spain), 10 Dec 2021 – 28 Feb 2022. Each of the participants was given a volume from an old edition of the Espasa Encylopedia, for it to be \"intervened\". The works ‘Pérez + Osete‘ and ‘La Gran Ladronera’ re-insert into the the Espasa Encylopedia two figures who were removed from it: José Pérez Hervás and Flora Osete (Silva-Villar, L., & Silva Villar, S. 2015a). It is done by means of two stamps, created with letters reproduced from the very encyclopedia to impress a couple of acronyms on pages extracted from it too. The first piece inserts the surnames ‘Pérez’ and ‘Osete’ as merged on the acronym Preziossette, which was coined by the family themlseves. The consonants in the surname ‘Osete’ were already duplicated on the traslation of the book Woman and Labour (Olive Schreiner, 1914), published as La mujer y el trabajo (1919) with Flora Ossette creadited as the translator. Later on, the same spelling was applied to the acronym coined by the family to name a music trio with their three daughters (Silva-Villar, L., & Silva Villar, S. 2015 b). The second piece stamps the portmanteau Espakalpe, made up by Pérez Hervás for the title of his book. According to its introduction it means “Es para Calpe” (This is to Calpe), implying that the owners of the publishing house Calpe took advantage of all the work carried out by Espasa’s employees (Pérez Hervás 1935, pp. 7-8, cited in Silva Villar 2015, p. 40).

The results of this study indicate that differentiation through specialisation is the best strategy to develop the Niagara wine region. However, the structure of the wine industry encourages wineries to produce a vast array of grape varieties to cater to the needs of the domestic market. This has resulted in a loss of identity for the region. Though because Niagara Riesling is differentiable, world class, the most consistently awarded grape and unreproducible elsewhere, it is the prime candidate to become the representative grape for the region. By developing the Niagara style of Riesling and focusing on exporting small amounts of the variety, the region would benefit by developing an identity and increasing consumer confidence and sales.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Discourse (both written text and talk) is treated as a social practice that is both central to understanding and constructing social reality and oriented to the practical concerns of everyday life. Discursive psychological approaches to intergroup communication have produced a large body of research examining everyday informal talk and institutional discourse on intergroup relations in liberal democratic societies. This work has focused primarily on the text and talk of majority group members and powerful elites about matters pertaining to race, immigration, ethnicity, and gender. How speakers attend to and account for group differences in discourse is perceived to be intimately related to the reproduction and legitimation of social inequalities in liberal democratic societies. This body of research has identified common and pervasive patterns of talk by majority group members that are seen as contributing to the continued marginalization and social exclusion of minorities. These discursive patterns include: positive self and negative other presentation, denials of prejudice, discursive deracialization, and using liberal arguments to justify and legitimate inequality", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The experimental test conditions include injection pressure values of up to 2000 bar. The results indicate that the assumptions behind the development of these fuel spray penetration models are not always valid for the in-cylinder spray conditions encountered in the present study. The results will form part of the basis for the development of appropriate correlations for high pressure diesel spray penetration models. Introduction The concern over the stringent emission legislations against diesel engine and the probability of outright ban across some developed cities of the world have made combustion and emission characteristics an active research area. Studies [1,2] have shown that these attributes are significantly influenced by diesel fuel injection and atomization characteristics. One way of optimising these events is by controlling the spray injected into the combustion chamber through increasing injection pressure. The evolution of diesel injection equipment from the jerk pump system to common rail system (CRS) has facilitated the increase in Injection pressure. With the CRS, injection pressure of 3500 bar is possible [3], and prediction of up to 4000 bar by 2020 [4]. This improved capacity is supporting the development of deeper understanding of the processes related to spray behaviour, which is responsible for the progress made thus far in reducing diesel emissions. However, the demand for accuracy and wish for more detail continue to grow with the increase in understanding. Spray formation is a complex process. Extensive studies [5-7] on the process have been conducted, there are still details that are yet to be understood. For example, studies [8] suggest fairly good consensus on which physical quantities have an effect on spray characteristics, but there are some discrepancies. This could be due to: wide range of injection systems, engine-related configurations (e.g. combustion system design), flow field characteristics, operating conditions (e.g. pressure and temperature levels) and fuel quality/composition. However, the analysis of spray penetration is crucial, especially in the design of high speed direct injection (HSDI) diesel combustion chamber. While under-penetration of (liquid) spray may result in poor air utilization, over-penetration may cause impingement on cool surfaces with little air swirl, reducing mixing rate and producing unburned fuel [9]. The effect of impingement can be linked with engine operations. At light loads and low speed conditions, unburned hydrocarbon emissions will be reduced if the contact between (liquid) spray and combustion chamber walls is avoided. In contrast, fume emissions will be reduced if this contact exists at heavy loads and high-speed conditions. It is therefore desirable to optimize fuel distribution within the combustion chamber together with high fuel air mixing rate. The main factors that are driving spray propagation studies include: the practical importance of spray penetration (e.g. optimization of spray penetration in internal combustion engines); spray penetration is easily measurable, which is useful for spray model validation; and the correct prediction of the spray penetration can indirectly reveal the correctness of complex models of spray formation. Investigations [5,10] have shown significant dependence of spray penetration on in-cylinder pressure and injection pressure. Spray penetration was defined to be a primary function of spray angle, nozzle hole diameter, and other conditions including the ambient gas density, temperature, injection pressure and injection duration [11]. Overall, several studies have tried to correlate spray penetration with time, injection pressure, ambient gas pressure and temperature. Some of these correlations are simplified and derived from the first principles, while others are from experimental results. The two groups are complementary, and are sometimes applied in parallel. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes use these correlations in modelling. However, this work focuses on the former models, since they usually facilitate the development of better insight into the physical background of the processes. Much from these simplified group of models have been presented/compared in the literature [5, 10, 13, 14]. Though there was a general agreement on key parameters that exert considerable influence on spray penetration, some of these studies differed on which proportions were important. Spray (cone) angle, which is strongly influenced by (characteristics) of nozzle design, is an important part of spray characterisation. Together with spray penetration, the cone angle", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

As such, dynamic capabilities help to answer a fundamental question of how a firm can develop skills and competencies which create and sustain competitive advantage (Zahra et al. 2006, Franco et al. 2009, Mitchell and Skrzypacz 2015). Purpose: While there is agreement that dynamic capabilities facilitate a firm’s competitiveness; there remains a lack of clarity around the notion and complexity surrounding the way in which they evolve (Eriksson, 2014). This, in particular, has created difficulties in identifying valid measurement tools to appraise their creation and deployment leading to the extant literature to rely upon qualitative, often longitudinal, case studies to analyse the phenomena (Wang and Ahmed, 2007, Barreto, 2010, Eriksson, 2014). This research employs a quantitative research approach to explore the influences of dynamic capabilities had on the competitive advantage and performance of SMEs, and to examine how the gender structure of management teams plays its role within this model. Design/methodology/approach This study is distinct from previous research as it employs a quantitative method and constructs a new multidimensional dynamic capability measurement by aggregating definitions, analysis and suggestions from previous literature to establish and test hypotheses (Teece, 2014). To measure competitive advantage, the validated measurements from Pisano and Wheelwright (1995), Hill and Jones (2007) and Wu, Wang, Tseng, and Wu (2009) will be employed. Measurements conducted by Lumpkin and Dess (2001) will be adopted to measure the performance of a firm. These measurements were validated by using the confirmatory factor analysis method before being utilized to examine a research framework. To test research hypotheses, this study uses structural equation modelling (SEM) and multi group structural model of two groups, management teams of majority male and teams of majority female or having a similar composition. Findings The results from structural model indicate that the dynamic capabilities of management teams have a significant positive impact on the competitive advantage, which in turn significantly positively influence the SME’s performance. However, there is no significant impact of dynamic capabilities on the SME’s performance were found. The results also show that, in SMEs led by management teams with majority male, dynamic capabilities have no significant influence on performance, but this relationship is significantly positive when firms were led by teams with majority female or having similar composition. Research limitations A new measurement to measure dynamic capabilities was conducted, but to ensure its validity and reliability it was developed and tested following standard protocols (De Vellis, 2003). Originality/value This study introduces a new validated measurement to examine dynamic capabilities, and empirically confirms the influence of dynamic capabilities had on a firm’s competitive advantage. It clarifies how the gender composition of management teams influence the relationships among dynamic capabilities, competitive advantage and performance of SMEs.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Every glimpse, touch and movement through a space records and connects on a sensory level. The buildings and spaces we move through, affect the way we see things, the way we feel and sense the world around us, directly or indirectly. Visiting buildings where art is on show, where we go to enjoy and experience art exhibitions or performances, immediately allow for sensory experiences, connecting us to the space at that very moment; creating a special place. As visitors, we become part of the building components, through our very presence, as we interact and move through, responding to the site, programme, theme, materiality and sensory qualities of the building.

However, a lack of understanding of the contribution made by a founding team to a spin-off’s performance still remains within current studies. Employing a resource-based view theory and social networks approach, this paper addresses this gap by exploring university spin-offs in Spain. Prior work: University spin-off studies have concentrated on analysing entrepreneurial business models (Ndonzuau et al., 2002, Vohora et al., 2004b, Bower, 2003, Mets, 2010) to understand how the commercialization of research is undertaken to create a university spin-off. University spin-offs were also been analysed from the perspective of a university’s capabilities (Powers and McDougall, 2005), or capabilities and social networks of an established spin-off instead of the founding teams (Walter et al., 2006). Moreover, Vohora et al. (2004a) and Shane (2004) have suggested founders need to build capable teams, which must have entrepreneurial capabilities and qualitative social networks, to create effective university spin-offs. Both entrepreneurial capability and social network theory have been studied in prior entrepreneurship research, but have received less attention within the context of the university spin-offs (Gonzalez-Pernia et al., 2013). Approach: Utilising an internet-based survey, this paper explores entrepreneurial capabilities and social networks of founding teams in Spanish university spin-offs using quantitative data analysis. Basing upon resource-based view theory of Barney (1991) to study entrepreneurial capabilities of the founding teams, the research employ entrepreneurial technology, strategy, human capital, organizational viability, and commercial resources (see Vohora et al., 2004a). To study social networks of a founding team, we employ the conceptual model of Hoang and Antoncic (2003) that divides networks into three components: structure, governance, and content. Results and implications: The results from an examination of the sample of 181 Spanish university spin-offs empirically demonstrate that by exploiting social networks a founding team can improve its entrepreneurial capabilities, which in turn enhance its spin-off’s performance. By employing the work of Vohora et al. (2004a) and Shane (2004), this paper constructs a model in which entrepreneurial capabilities play a mediate role between social networks and spin-off’s performance. Thus, the paper has implications for universities in training and policy development to support spin-off’s activity. Value: This study addresses some fundamental questions to contribute to the theory-based understanding of university spin-offs: How do entrepreneurial capabilities of founding teams influence the performance of university spin-offs? How do social networks of founding teams contribute to the process of the university spin-offs?", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

So, where the service encounter is standardized, organizations rely on external bureaucratic controls while organizations whose service offer is customized use normative controls given their greater reliance on front line staff for service delivery. This argument is underpinned by the notion of “best fit” between competitive strategies and HRM style. However, this notion is limiting because it does not take into consideration broader sectoral issues that mediate the relationship between service offer and types of control. This paper addresses this limitation through a case study of a “McDonaldized” restaurant chain in the UK. Contrary to the above argument, the evidence shows that the company employed a family-based type of control which aimed to address the perennial issue of high labour turnover which is common in hospitality. The relative success of normative control in this case is explained by the fact that it did not co-exist with other, more militaristic forms of control as is often the case in fast-food outlets.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Concept art for these futuristic vehicles often show passengers sat facing each other, reading, working or enjoying some other activity as their car does the driving for them. I would argue that one of the main attractions of an automated vehicle is being able to do something else while you’re safely and comfortably transported to your destination. But my PhD research suggests we’ll never be as comfortable or productive as these visions portray without finding a way to combat motion sickness. Just as passengers in human-driven cars can easily feel sick if they don’t look out the window, giving up control to a self-driving vehicle to focus on something else will likely to lead to queasiness. In one recent experiment, my colleagues and I found that facing backwards in a driverless car increases motion sickness symptoms in 100% of passengers during normal urban driving. This echoes previous research that shows not being able to see out the front of a vehicle can worsen motion sickness. In another experiment, again echoing other research, we found that ability to perform a simple reading task was reduced by 40%, simply by being driven around at normal speeds on a normal urban route. However, we’ve also found that there might be technological ways to combat this problem. Motion sickness is caused by a conflict between the signals from our different senses. When our eyes observe the environment, our inner ears sense if we are moving. When the two signals do not match then we are more likely to develop motion sickness. For example, if you read a book in a car, your eyes see the stationary item but your ears tell your brain you are moving. The reverse is also true for so-called virtual reality sickness, where your eyes are immersed in a rich tapestry of information that tells you you are moving, but your inner ears can’t detect any movement, leading to similar symptoms to motion sickness. Will driverless cars make this sight more common?  Metamorworks/Shutterstock Everyone except the profoundly deaf or those with true vestibular dysfunction is susceptible to motion sickness. The extent of the problem can depend on age, ethnicity, gender and past experiences. For example, Chinese people are generally more sensitive than white Europeans, females are more sensitive than males, and 11-year-olds are the most sensitive. Drivers, however, don’t suffer motion sickness because they are aware of the likely future motion of the vehicle, like helmsman on boats. As a result, they tend to do things like tilt their heads against the turn of the car, which counteracts the forces of motion (whereas passengers tend to tilt with the bend). The main solution to motion sickness is to look at a fixed object in the direction you are travelling so that your eyes send the same signal to your brain about how you are moving as your inner ears do. This means it will be difficult for driverless cars to include rear-facing seats from where you can’t see in the direction of travel. Other information that can tell us about the future movement of the vehicle can help minimise motion sickness. This can include voice cues from a satnav, directional lighting showing which way the car is going to turn, and virtual horizons that display where the real horizon would be.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

This scaling-up of design features has often resulted in the creation of amorphous, incoherent and incongruous masses of steel and aluminium.\n\nSuperyachts spend a large proportion of their existences in-dock, stationary aside from the movement of the water. We can therefore justify analysing them within the context of architecture, where buildings with such vast expanses of unbroken white surface are rarely seen. When such instances do occur, criticism soon follows – the Benthem Crouwel Wing of the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam has been dubbed ‘The Bathtub’, and is widely derided. Whilst no such formalised and directed criticism of superyacht design exists as yet, there is clearly an opportunity for a rethink.\n\nThis paper summarises research and development activities, where in-depth visual analysis of contemporary architecture has informed design output.

In general, all the proofs are redone after every evolution, which is very expensive in terms of cost and time. In this work, we propose a slicing based solution to add an adequate verification process to iterative refinements and incremental development technique. Our proposal has two objectives, the first is to perform verification only on those parts that may influence the property satisfaction by the analyzed model. The second is to classify the evolutions and properties to identify which evolutions require re-verification. We argue that for the class of evolutions that requires re-verification, instead of verifying the whole system only a part that is concerned by the property would be sufficient.

Yet, there are still only few publications offering a contemporary view on how the relation between movement and space can be tied to the descriptions and analyses of actual movement practice. Already owing to its embodied nature, dance is essentially spatial. It forms, produces, and takes place in space. It is thus no coincidence that dance studies have increasingly begun to address the complex issue of movement and space. \n\nThis anthology aims to link conceptual descriptions that concern space as process and in process to the undertakings of specific movement practices in dance. The articles in the anthology address how historical and geopolitical influences impact our understanding and practice of dance art. In them, the kinds of spaces and interrelationships, which different forms of dancing generate, are considered. Aspects of embodied space that dancing relies upon are likewise discussed.

Taking the initiative and mobilizing others to get involved are useful skills when fundraising for your local sports team, or establishing a new social enterprise. Understanding how to put a plan into action and use finances wisely are relevant for your own life and for business planning in an SME. EntreComp is new, so those using it are just starting out in their use of the framework and exploring how it can be implemented in practice. The examples gathered here are intended to illustrate the breadth and depth of potential for using EntreComp, but this will of course evolve through time and experience. This guide is intended to inspire more actors across Europe and beyond to get involved, to join a community of participants committed to embedding these competences for life into education, communities, work and enterprise.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Identity defines and gives meaning to an entity (e.g., Corley et al., 2006) and under conditions of uncertainty or ambiguity (McMullen & Shepherd, 2006), takes on heightened importance, functioning as a device for sensemaking (Weber & Glynn, 2006; Weick, 1995). Despite a growing interest in matters of identity in organizational studies, researchers know relatively little about how identities are formed among those who carry out some highly critical organizational functions (Pratt et al., 2006). New venture creation is a specific type of organization where the nascent entrepreneur carries out critical organizational functions such as, idea generation, opportunity recognition and new venture creation (Katz & Gartner, 1988). Identity is thus, important in entrepreneurship; especially in early stages when new venture ideas are fragile and nascent entrepreneurs are vulnerable to liabilities of newness (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994). Despite literature (e.g. Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001; Martens et al., 2007; Navis & Glynn, 2010, 2011; Fauchart et al., 2011) that suggests identity changes accompany new venture creation, the process by which identity evolves remains under explained (Ibarra, 1999). Applicability to the conference theme – ‘Research, policy and practice:Collaboration in a disparate world’ Identity pervades and is embedded in the process of new venture creation at three levels of analysis—the founder (individual level), the proposed new venture (organizational level), and the focal, institutional (market level) sector (Navis & Glynn, 2011; Gartner, 1985). “Who an entrepreneur is” is therefore, both an individual and a social construction. This is because individual identities are constituted out of a process of interaction (Weick, 1995). The development of entrepreneurial identity is visible through the narrative construction of the entrepreneurial journey, and what the entrepreneur does and who they collaborate with is an important part of ‘becoming’ and acting as an entrepreneur in society (Rae, 2007). Consequently, the paper is linked to the conference theme through the exploration of the interactional processes occurring during new venture creation, which may shape entrepreneurial identity. Aim In this paper, we seek to build on calls (e.g. Cardon et al., 2009) for a greater specification of identity in entrepreneurship by conceptualizing and mapping entrepreneurial identity (individual and organizational) as it unfolds during the nascent entrepreneurial process. The aim of the paper is to connect the entrepreneurship, sensemaking and identity literatures by exploring the following research question: how nascent entrepreneurs construct their entrepreneurial identity during pre-venture formation. Starting a new venture requires the entrepreneur to “develop a vision or mental model of how the environment works and then be able to communicate with others and gain their support” (Hill & Levenhagen, 1995:1057; Gioia & Chittipeddi, 1991). Part of developing this vision or mental model involves establishing an identity (Hill & Levenhagen, 1995). Nascent entrepreneurs begin to construct an entrepreneurial identity individually, collectively (e.g., as a team) and as an organization by asking questions about “who they are, why they are qualified, what they want to do, and why they think they will succeed” (Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001:550) and then attempt to make this identity plausible to others. While there is burgeoning literature on the role of identities in entrepreneurship (e.g. Navis & Glynn, 2011; Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001; Martens, Jennings, & Jennings, 2007), less research has been directed at understanding how an entrepreneur makes sense of both individual and organizational identity and develops that identity alongside the development of new venture ideas. Consequently, we have only a partial understanding of the process of venture emergence and one that neglects in particular, the identity-process associated to the transition between being a nascent entrepreneur and founding a new venture. In this paper, we propose a framework of the identity-process associated to the transition between being a nascent entrepreneur and founding a new venture. Methodology To explore identity dynamics of ‘becoming’ an entrepreneur, a constructivist epistemology and case study methodology was adopted (Cunliffe, 2011; Yin, 2017). We draw on case study evidence from three student entrepreneurs working with venture ideas in a business incubator. This is an apposite context to study entrepreneurial identity formation as the incubation environment provides time and space for students to allocate a portion of their “identity work” (Jenkins, 2008) to experimenting with the social identities associated with an entrepreneur. We draw on this context to understand the period of transition, beginning with the venture idea, and then following the actions and events as the student entrepreneurs make sense of their identity alongside the development of venture ideas and the specific identity formation processes they undergo. Contribution In developing our arguments, we make two contributions. First, we identify the specific identity-process through which entrepreneurs create an entrepreneurial identity to legitimate their entrepreneurial enactments. The framework we develop provides further insight into the role of identity in the entrepreneurial process, having both theoretical and practical relevance. Second, we frame entrepreneurship as a site of identity creation and interpretation, to which scarce attention has been paid to in the identity literature as a visible instance of identity work.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

This shift serves to distinguish Xi’s New Era from the Deng-Jiang-Hu post-reform era, which concerned itself primarily with perpetuating a legitimacy predicated on economic opportunity and double-digit growth. Cultural power is now being pursued through a highly choreographed orchestration of both coercive and consensus-building initiatives mediated through the political state apparatus, civil society institutions, and the private sector. The result is a systematic and ongoing monopolization of cultural power, effectively terraforming a superstructural landscape where all institutions in the political, civil, and commercial realms are not only captured and subjugated but effectively mobilized under the aegis of Xi’s umbrella project of the China Dream (中国梦). Unraveling the array of techniques, tactics, and strategies is a challenging proposition for both those on the ground and for external observers. Here we will examine several tenets of the Xi administration’s efforts to both harness and wield cultural power. We begin with a brief discussion of base/superstructure distinction in relation to Xi’s New Era. Discussion then moves to provide an overview of the Party’s cultural objectives outlined at the 18th and 19th Party Congresses before examining three key aspects of the Party’s cultural landscaping: ideas, institutions, and civic spaces.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Traditionally Oulu’s economy centred on the timber, tar, paper and pulp industries along with a little iron and steel making. Following the Second World War down to the 1960s the area fell into economic decline and experienced high levels of outward migration, low standards of living and an above average mortality rate.\nOstrobothnia’s difficulties in essence mirrored those of Northern Finland in general and the National Government in Helsinki had little choice but to enact a positive regional policy to try to effect a turnaround. Instrumental in this was the establishment in 1956 of the University of Oulu and its attendant Medical School. The university was specifically charged to work towards revitalising the economy. Fundamental to this was the Department of Electrical Engineering which in conjunction with others saw that the way forward lay in the development of a knowledge economy, and in conjunction with the City Council a Technology Park (Technopolis) was established in 1980 alongside the University. The government played its part by opening branches of Tekes and VTT in the city to facilitate the growth of entrepreneurship. Indeed, this was a fine example of the Triple Helix at work.\nThe outcome was that a number of small firms in electronics and ICT industries established themselves in the City, as did Nokia, and within a relatively short space of time, Oulu became the leading centre for High Tech industries in the Nordic Countries, gaining a world-wide reputation.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

With the arrival of digital music, and its inherent culture of digitality, new issues have emerged regarding musical engagement at the level of fan and/or consumer. This paper will explore what and where people are engaging with music, as mediated by technology. These two issues will be categorised by: (1) the immense quantity of popular music available digitally is promoting a culture of eclecticism, whereby people are not tied to specific genres when defining their tastes. Personal genre alliance has fallen out of favour, and replaced by fluid definitions of genres and artists, that are user-driven and highly personalised and subjective: for example, folksonomies. (2) One of the primary ways in which people consume music is through portable media devices, such as the iPods. My data shows that people are predominantly utilising these devices in three sites of engagement: mobile, immobile and quasi-mobile activities. These issues are explored through the results of a large-scale, international study, utilising both quantitative and qualitative approaches, in the form of interviews and surveys, both conducted online and in person. Throughout this paper, I make distinctions between how digital youth, or digital natives, those under the age of thirty who have grown up entirely immersed in digitality, and those over thirty, or digital immigrants, have developed diverse systems of musical engagement. I argue that digital youth, whose relationship with music is increasingly mediated by digital technologies, such as the iPod, are no less emotionally engaged with music than their older counterparts, but their tastes are less genre-focused.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Extraction times are reduced, which ultimately leads to economic savings to the manufacturer. By using high-power lower-frequency ultrasound (20–40 kHz), mechanical effects are generated within the food material (in liquid form), which results in efficient mixing and homogenization. As a result this can also aid other processes, such as cleaning/sterilization and extraction of natural products. By using higher ultrasonic frequencies (300 kHz and above), more chemical and biochemical effects are observed, which could affect the food material, such as enhanced oxidation/aging or increasing kill rates of food microbes. This chapter covers a range of areas, which have employed ultrasound to process food materials, such as extraction of plants, seeds, and fruit, recycling of food waste, effects on the properties of meat and dairy products, and also includes some discussion on scale-up processes.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The creative industry is mostly concentrated in Istanbul and Ankara. The film industry is the largest contributor to the economy estimated to be worth around 400 million Euros in 2008. However, there is still limited knowledge related to the composition of the creative sector in Turkey and its’ spill over effects on the economy. This paper suggests a methodology to analyse the spill over effects of the creative industries in Turkey drawing from the methodologies that have been widely used in the United Kingdom, therefore, providing a framework of analysis that can be used by researchers to further expand the knowledge in this area.

At its simplest profiling helps individuals become lifelong learners (Hull et al 2005) prepared to embrace change. This presentation will focus on the outcomes of a single-site case study which explored occupational therapy students’ attitudes and experiences of profiling in the context of their early professional development. With ongoing NHS reforms, healthcare practitioners must be adaptable, have ‘capabilities and skills to provide new models of personalised care’ (DH 2010:13). Students entering practice therefore need to be intellectually and emotionally prepared to work flexibly and face challenges and opportunities of change positively. The profiling system explored aims to support students in becoming lifelong learners through the process of integrating University-based studies and practice-based learning. Reflection and reflective writing underpins profiling as it lies at the interface between theory and practice and advancement of knowledge. It may be seen as a ‘melting pot’ or ‘cognitive housekeeping’ to imply a sorting out, clarifying process (Moon 2004:189) fundamental to personal professional development. A cross-sectional cohort approach was adopted which employed a survey design of quantitative and qualitative data-gathering questionnaires with a sample of students from each year for inclusivity. Attitudes and experiences of students were further explored through semi-structured interviews. Findings suggest students generally appear to have a positive attitude to personal profiling. The value is experienced at varying psychological levels, depending on students’ willingness, motivation to engage with the process and psychological preparedness. A model of levels of engagement in profiling is proposed with students’ experiences indicating that the process of profiling is challenging, psychologically messy and an uncertain process yet worthwhile in the overall pursuit of professional development. The conclusion drawn from the study is that students have the intellectual capability and potential to benefit from personal profiling. Students appear to self-consciously recognise, articulate and acknowledge the value of personal profiling in facilitating early professional development.

The concerns for the role of art amidst the forces of a post-modern world are influenced by important legacies of the past, by which ideas about human identity and difference have been made meaningful in the relation of history and technology. In the frequently transient and conflicting forces of humanness and forces of modernity, the digital world of the arts emerges as a means by which new ideas of space and time can be considered, with new perspectives of human identity seen as states of being, towards the possibilities of experience, technology, individuality and society.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

This discrepancy can be associated with significant levels of psychological ill-health (Zapf, Seifert, Schmutte, Mertini,  Holz, 2001). Policing is consistently ranked among the top five stressful/high-risk occupations (e.g. Coman, Evans, Stanley,  Burrows, 1991). Police officers act as the front-line contact when dealing directly with community members; they are expected to be social workers, teachers, role models, and counsellors.

It adopts information processing theory to investigate risk management strategies that can control the uncertainties from international logistics. It also develops and validates the measurement items for those strategies.\nResearch Approach: This study rigorously applies both qualitative and quantitative methods. The concepts of strategies were framed by information processing theory and then populated by the review of the relevant studies and interviews with eight companies involved in international logistics. The measurement model, built upon the conceptualised research model, was tested by Q-sorting methods and pilot tests to ensure the content validity. A large-scale survey was later conducted with logistics professionals in South Korea. The results were analysed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis for testing validity and reliability of the research model.\nFindings and Originality: Extant research has suggested diverse operational/tactical responses to supply chain risks, but often these are not incorporated into logistics strategies. With the emphasis on the information and relationship management as the key drivers of managing international logistics risks, this study suggests four distinctive strategies which are (1) building a stable logistics network, (2) leveraging logistics information, (3) leveraging outsourcing contracts and (4) developing logistics collaboration. The scale items to measure the level of implementing the strategies were also suggested in reflection of various logistics tactics and practices to achieve the strategic goals. \nResearch Impact: This is the first study to investigate the strategic dimensions of risk management for international logistics, which shows risk mitigating strategies can be differentiated in a firm’s strategic priorities. It also categorises diverse operational/tactical practices into four distinctive strategies with empirical rigor. \nPractical Impact: Firms can assess their level of risk management by using the measurement scales and can benchmark the best risk management knowledge and practices for international logistics operations. The strategies will indicate a firm’s direction of risk management based on top management decisions, organisational culture and logistics circumstances.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

After 24 h cell incubation, no cells were observed on the untreated MgO-PSZ, whereas cells were seen to have attached onto the CO 2 laser treated MgO-PSZ and exhibited spreading and good attachment. Moreover, the cell coverage density implied an increase in cell proliferation with increasing CO 2 laser power density. Enhancement of the surface energy of the MgO-PSZ, especially its polar component, caused by the CO 2 laser treatment was found to play a significant role in the initial cell attachment process, thereby leading to enhanced cell growth.

Scarring, or wound healing, is considered a form of bodydisfigurement and is associated with psychosocial difficulties, including areas of body imageand quality of life. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the relationships betweenobjective and subjective wound healing, between objective wound healing and serumcortisol levels, and between perceived stress and serum cortisol levels in womenundergoing post-mastectomy breast reconstruction. Methods: Nineteen women undergoing post-mastectomy breast reconstruction wererecruited to a pilot study. At one week prior, one week after, and one month after surgery,participants completed fifteen saliva samples at each time-point as well as measures forpsychosocial factors, including stress (PSS) and subjective wound healing. Objective measurement of wound healing was conducted at three to eight weeks post-surgery using the EPISCAN, a high frequency ultrasound imaging system. Serum cortisol levels analysed with salivary cortisol enzyme immunoassay. Findings: A Pearson‘s correlation was computed to assess the relationship between perceived stress and subjective wound healing of the reconstructed breast(s) at one month post-surgery. There was a positive correlation between the two variables, r = 0.530, n =13, p = 0.031. Discussion: This output is significant in its combination of multiple methodologies to address the research aims; this output will add new knowledge that will contribute to the understanding of how women heal after a breast reconstruction and how the role psychosocial difficulties may play in wound healing.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The aim of this paper is to compare hedging in two written legal genres which are frequently used by post-graduate law students to underpin their own academic essays: Law review articles and Supreme Court decisions. To that end, two analyses were undertaken. The first was qualitative in nature and involved the identification of hedges in a small corpus of just under 50,000 words based on introspection and intuition as per Salager-Meyer (2000). The second analysis served to verify conclusions drawn by using WordSmith Tools 6.0 (Scott 2013) and a much larger corpus of nearly eight million words.

With novel approaches being identified to increase student engagement and enhance their learning experience. Every learning individual is different, and Project Management as a discipline is no different, although encounters major challenges when being delivered to students from diverse backgrounds and experiences. Much literature had discussed the use of gamification concepts to facilitate educational delivery and enhancement. In line with pedagogical literature, this paper explores a novel approach adopted within Coventry University, wherein the students were tasked with applying their project management knowledge to the development of a Project Management educational game. This allowed them to apply their knowledge to the developmental process, through an experiential learning approach. Not only this, but as these students were learners themselves, they were able to infuse the game with what they deemed suitable for their learning style, leading to the development of a project management educational game that tailors for different learners, embeds gamification and engagement concepts and imparts the knowledge required. This paper looks at the approach adopted, the milestones achieved by the students, the learning experience encountered and how the challenges that were encountered were overcome, with a case study of Postgraduate students. Thus challenging the status quo in terms of delivery of Project Management educational experience through a novel approach where the students acquired new skill sets along the way, while applying their knowledge of Project management principles to the project at hand, while critically reflecting on their knowledge as they develop the game to educate and challenge potential learners while imparting this knowledge upon them.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

These drinking practices are enormously varied and are spatially and culturally defined. The contributions to the volume draw on research settings from across the UK and beyond to demonstrate both the complexity and diversity of drinking subjectivities and practices. Across these examples tensions relating to gender, social class, age and the life course are particularly prominent. Rather than align to now long-established moral discourses about what constitutes ‘good’ and ‘bad’ drinking, sociological approaches to alcohol foreground the vivid, lived, nature of alcohol consumption and the associated experiences of drunkenness and intoxication. In doing so, the volume illuminates the controversial yet important social and cultural roles played by drink for individuals and groups across a range of social contexts.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The article evaluates two examples of the African alternative model. First, a long-standing partnership in southern Sudan where policing is provided by customary chiefs. Second, one that is emerging in Liberia in the wake of the failure of a partnership based on community police forums.

Over-penetration can lead to fuel spray collisions with the combustion chamber walls whilst under-penetration might lead to poor air-fuel mixture. In each case, the resultant fuel consumption and exhaust emission levels might be unsatisfactory. Hence, several fuel spray penetration correlations have been developed over the decades and these have been found to be applicable, to various degrees, to internal combustion engines of various types.\nAs concerns over engine emissions levels grow, research into improving the efficiency of diesel and gasoline engines has intensified and this has included work on the use of bio fuels. Therefore, existing fuel spray penetration correlations have to be assessed for use in the design of engines using bio fuels.\nThe application of correlations for fuel spray penetration for soybean oil methyl ester (SME) fuel under varying injection pressure and ambient temperature conditions are presented. The conditions range from 60 to 120 MPa injection pressure and 300 to 450 K ambient temperature values. Analyses of the results indicate that the correlations do not give satisfactory predictions of the fuel spray penetration for SME fuel under these conditions.

Taking Tehran as the case of this study, this paper is set to elaborate the complex condition of this city in order to introduce to English-speaking readers a range of theories that seek to conceptualise the conditions of Iran from different angles. In doing so, firstly, I explain that why it is necessary to reconsider some Western categories when applying to a nonWestern setting such as Tehran. For example the Western dichotomy of private/public space cannot hold its original meaning when applying in a non-Western context. Rather, in Tehran and in Iran at large, historically, the city was a king’s property which was creating a binary of home-street as Iranian city dwellers took home as a space of peace, whereas, streets (spaces outside homes) were the practical terrain of power performances; Arbab(public)/Ra’yat(private) space. However, this is not the only endeavour of this study. The other aim of this paper is to depict a socio-political picture of the urban Tehran today and the ways that people, unexpectedly, re-claim the mechanism of established power and transform the qualities of public space. Exploring semi-public/semi-private spaces in Tehran, such as taxi or café, this paper explores the massive contradictions and ‘in-between’ balances between freedom/control, tradition/modernity as a subtle or ‘velvet’ form of resistance carries out daily by people in Tehran, especially women and youth. Not only that, it also will be argued that when public space (Arbab) is policed and controlled, domestic interiors (Ra’yat) cease to be the exclusive domain for individual and family life. Rather, they become the spaces of practicing new forms of collective life such as art galleries, workshops, clubs, cultural centres, and offices.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Arguably, this will enhance market penetration, increase patronage and higher level of profit. Theoretically however, ethical behaviour can be institutionalized in organizations if the top management support ethical behaviour through punishment and reward (high ethical climate). Other than corporate ethical values, managers? beliefs about the rightness and wrongness of an action in a particular situation could also be a function of his/her personal moral philosophy. With respect to financial services, one aspect of marketing which have been empirically shown to have influence ethical judgement and behaviours of managers is sales quotas. When salespersons are assigned higher sales quotas, which are perceived as difficult, the tendency to engage in unethical behaviour to achieve this target becomes higher. In this study, we assess and extend the theoretical relationship between moral judgement of salespersons and perceived quota difficulty in the insurance industry. The study also explores the moderating effects of salesperson?s ethical values (idealism and relativism), corporate ethical climate, and quota failure consequences on the proposed relationship. With a structured questionnaire, data was collected from respondents in the target industry through a multi-stage sampling strategy. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to assess the factorial structure of the measures used in the study, their reliability and validity. Using correlation and regression analysis, the results were presented and discussed with managerial implications for the Nigerian insurance industry.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The objectives of this research are three-fold. The first is to conceptualise\nthe dimensions of CSR in supply chains, highlighting which dimension is prioritised in the\npractice. The second is to demonstrate to what degree SMEs implement CSR practices.\nThe third is to explore the contingencies that drive and enable SMEs’ CSR practices based\non the institutional theory and the stakeholder theory.\nDesign/methodology/approach:\nA large-scale questionnaire survey was conducted with SMEs in South Korea. A total of\n200 questionnaires were distributed via email to the SMEs based in the Gyeongbuk\nProvince of South Kore, and 87 usable questionnaires were collected. The data were\nanalysed by analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a 2X2 matrix and ANOVA to demonstrate\nthe SCR implementation level and the contingencies behind it.\nFindings:\nSMEs tend to focus on explicit CSR practices that can be easily identified their customers.\nOn the contrary, operational issues hidden to the customers are not considered in SMEs’\npractices. ANOVA analysis empirically showed that stakeholder and institutional pressures\nare valid in the performance of SCR practices. However, the level of pressures was\nlargely biased to customers, government and regulatory pressures, which means that\nSMEs are more reactive rather than proactive to implement CSR practices.\nValue:\nThis research investigated CSR practices within supply chains particularly from the SME\nperspectives, which have not been fully explored in the supply chain management\ndiscipline. In addition, it will empirically analyse the contingencies of CSR\nimplementations using survey data.\nResearch limitations/implications:\nThis study has a limitation in conducting the survey with SMEs in one country, which may\nreduce the generalisability of this research.\nPractical implications:\nThe conceptual model to evaluate the degree of SCR implementation can be used as an\nindex to compare the CSR level of the SMEs.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

From osteoblast cell response tests it was ascertained that cell adhesion and proliferation on the Nd:YAG laser treated Ti6Al4V alloy samples was considerably greater than on the untreated samples. By isolating the effects of surface roughness it was possible to confirm or refute the existence of a correlation between wettability characteristics and osteoblast cell bioactivity for the Nd:YAG laser treated Ti6Al4V alloy. The findings indicate that wettability characteristics (especially the surface oxygen content and the polar component of the surface energy) play an important role in promoting cell proliferation, particularly when surface roughness was simultaneously increased.

Due to the obvious modular form and flexibility of the shipping container, it inevitably steers the design development somewhat. Once the traditional shipping container has been collected, transported, shipped, stripped and delivered – the range of architectural design options is endless. Existing and additional pre-fabrication of components makes the construction process faster, more efficient and perhaps also predictable to a certain degree. The key is in the creative process; the imagination, the conceptual strength of the design and the route the architects take to transform this hard surfaced steel beast into an ergonomic, human scale space. Challenges in the reuse and remodeling of these existing structures, can be difficult and diverse, the treatment of the steel, for example, can be a costly, difficult, time consuming job, although the positives outweigh some of this.

Drawing on Sarasvathy (2001) and Stevenson & Jarillo (1990), they go on to argue that, “the entrepreneur needs to garner support, obtain the required resources and generate enough commitment from organisational stakeholders to take the idea from vision to reality” (Edelman and Yli-Renko, 2010: 834).\nFirms take time to establish and emerge through a series of actions. The route may be causally driven or the result of effectuation (Sarasvathy, 2001a, 2001b); one being the inverse of the other (ibid: 2001a:2). From a causal perspective there is a predetermined goal and a set of means; the aim being to seek the most efficient way possible to achieve the goal. Effectual reasoning begins with the means and allows the goals to emerge over time (ibid).  Sarasvathy argues that entrepreneurs prefer effectual reasoning over causal reasoning in the early stages of venture creation. As the venture becomes established, the transition from causal to effectual must be managed and this poses a problem for some entrepreneurs. \nCausal thinking, (aligned with traditional managerialist thinking), is based on the extent to which it is believed that we can predict the future and control it (ibid: 6). Predictive tools and business management models support and encourage this logic. Effectual thinking on the other hand, is emergent and can accommodate multiple potential outcomes for a given range of means; this approach is more associated with entrepreneurial thinking.\nReality, however, is often more complex than predictive tools are able to deal with (Obolensky, 2010). Managers, leaders and entrepreneurs have to be reactive or adaptive and responsive to complexity. Entrepreneurship, if effectively managed, should be able to reconcile the need for a vision and expectation of the future, whilst at the same time being able to adapt to the deeper uncertainty manifest in a changing dynamic environment. \nWhile rule based systems, such as universities, like the certainty of causal thinking, they also understand that effectual thinking, with its inbuilt serendipity, has the potential to create more impactful entrepreneurial outcomes. Drawing upon two case studies, this paper will explore the challenges and opportunities faced by effectual and causal thinking in the design of Venture Creation Programmes (VCPs) for undergraduate students. In both cases the programmes were intended to be effectual in spirit, but one is unintentionally causal by design. Interest in VCP development is likely to follow a similar trajectory to the growing interest in enterprise and entrepreneurship education. This paper could help to inform thinking about the nature of VCP development and where such programmes should be sited (or positioned) within universities.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

In this paper, the Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based simulation optimisation approach is used for the optimal allocation of different crews of workers on different precast concrete production processes. A Precast-Component manufacturing simulation model is integrated to GA-based optimisation model to simulate the physical processes that are involved in the manufacturing system and to optimise the allocation of labour crews. The proposed approach determines the optimal or near optimal allocation of crews for the processes involved within the precast manufacturing system., This should eventually lead to maximum utilisation of the set of skilled workers involved in the allocated crew and subsequently minimise the total labour costs. The paper discusses a simulation system dubbed “SIM_Crew” that was developed during this study. This simulation model is developed as a test bench for the proposed intelligent allocation system. GA is used to guide simulation towards the best course of action; chromosome is designed well to involve all the decision variables.

Central to the legitimization and justification of hosting mega-events, bidding cities emphasize and attempt to create positive, inclusive local socio-economic development ambitions to maximize the strategic value of hosting (Chalip, 2017). Smith (2012) argues that so-called “Olympic legacies” have become a central feature of MSEs, focusing on the likely things to be 'bequeathed' by host country, city and communities. However, major international policy (e.g. OECD, 2008) and domestic governmental organisations (e.g. House of Lords, 2013) have, and continue to question the uneven and inequitable local developmental outcomes of MSEs. Yet, this contrasts the IOC’s virtuous aim of building “sustainable” communities as extolled in the Olympic 2020 Agenda, and across specific host city candidature bids. Empowering host city communities and fostering a legacy of social and economic growth at the heart of Rio’s 2016 Candidature Bid (2009), and the IOC’s wider Olympic 2020 Agenda. Both IOC and host city developmental objectives, specifically since London 2012, have placed entrepreneurship (including social entrepreneurship (SE)) as a key way to achieve positive regional development legacies. Yet, although we know why building entrepreneurial capacity is vital for leveraging the Olympic opportunity, little to no research examines how locals within specifically targeted host communities can approach entrepreneurship – and be entrepreneurial – in the highly circumscribed, contested and dynamic business environments created by the coming and ‘live staging’ of MSEs. We explore the approach of ‘bricolage’ to explore, specifically, how entrepreneurial individuals and collectives residing within deprived and/or ‘slum’ communities (e.g. favelas in the context of Rio 2016, and areas of East London for London 2012) can utilise a disparate amalgam of local resources and networks to leverage. We argue that a creative, pro-active approach by local entrepreneurs, institutionally supported by external agencies like the IOC, National Olympic Committees (NOCs) and local government and authorities could be vital in ensuring that less-visible host communities prosper from the Games alongside new and established gentrified urban communities and touristic hot spots. By doing so, MSEs may be able to better (re)distributed social and economic benefits back into the development of communities who served to legitimise and justify event policy intervention in the first place (Pappalepore and Duignan, 2016).", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

A combination of a highly volatile sector and a job made up of a myriad of different parts means that the role involves a number of competing pressures which can leave managers feeling isolated, confused and adrift from previous certainties. Many managers speak of ‘putting on an act’ or hiding their true thoughts from those around them at work (Fried-Buchalter, 1997). Using the work of Goffman (1959), Ecclestone (2007) and Bimrose and Brown (2010), this paper explores the self-identity of a group of twenty managers in the sector who have made the transition from lecturer to manager. Using semi-structured questionnaires and a thematic analysis of results, the research concluded that many of the managers overcame the pressures of their new role by establishing a philosophical driver that could be defined as a set of values, beliefs and personal goals that influenced all decision made as a manager.

With over 160 official centres worldwide, S. N. Goenka’s Vipassana movement is one of the most successful organizations that offer Buddhist meditation as a self-development tool to the public, and a “rehabilitating tool” to prison inmates. The question of rehabilitative efficacy of Vipassana meditation has attracted much scholarly attention in recent years, particularly from the field of clinical psychology (Bowen et al., 2015; Perelman et al., 2014; Samuelson et al., 2007; Simpson et al., 2007). Less qualitative research, however, has explored the effects of Vipassana meditation on practitioners’ religiosity. Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews with long-term meditators, who reside at the Vipassana centre in New Zealand and report addiction recovery, this chapter introduces a pattern of conversion that has been widely neglected in previous studies. ‘Tacit conversion’ which results from a disconnection between language and lived experience, occurs in movements that constantly reject association with religion. Goenka’s Vipassana organization is a case in point where instead of teaching Buddhist meditation, they claim to teach a “scientific,” “non-sectarian” and “universal” technique that does not require religious conversion. As a result, Vipassana practitioners reject the notion of conversion, maintaining that their approach to the technique is purely non-religious. Yet the analysis of these narratives suggests other wise. Inspired by Peter Stromberg’s (1993) linguistic approach to conversion, the first section of this chapter illustrates the extent to which the structure and content of these self-transformation narratives resembles those which in other traditions have been categorised as “conversion narratives” (Harding, 1987; Popp-Baier, 2001; 2002; Stromberg, 1993). The later section of this chapter explores the influence of the movement’s discourse on the practitioners’ language and reasoning and demonstrates how the movement’s rhetorical patterns work as a mechanism to conceal conversion and hence facilitate what I refer to as tacit conversion.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

In 2016, the company wanted to expand its \"electric highway\"—a network of charging stations for electric vehicles along major U.K. motorways. The expansion plans involved two chargers: Type A chargers, installed in public locations along the motorway, and Type B chargers, installed in suitable home garages owned by Ecotricity customers. To meet the projected traffic flow of electric vehicles in the future, the company needed to optimally expand the number of both types of charging points in each highway zone.

Since the crime and the punishment come as a 'package deal' this book looks at both the legal nature of the offence and at the current operation of the mandatory life sentence. Not only does the book adopt a critical approach, by assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the status quo, it also draws upon comparative material from both common and civil law jurisdictions in an attempt to provide a comprehensive exploration of these issues. The need for public confidence in the criminal justice system is particularly acute in the way it deals with the most serious homicides. In this book the authors report findings from the first systematic exploration of public attitudes to sentencing murder in this or any other common law jurisdiction. The picture of public opinion emerging from this recent large-scale nationwide qualitative and quantitative survey, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, is likely to surprise many, and will be of interest to all jurisdictions where the mandatory life sentence for murder has been questioned.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Use of traditional fallows to restore soil productive capacity via organic matter accruement has been compromised by population growth in West Africa and increased land degradation (Bonetti and Jouve, 1999). Continued crop cultivation and insufficient fallow periods have thus, led to severe soil organic matter depletion and subsequent soil degradation in semi-arid West Africa. This situation ultimately undermines food provision of local farm communities and may affect irreversibly ecosystem provision and regulation services within these landscapes. Improved use of local manure and compost as options to regenerate soils may be limited by availability (usually in homestead enclosures), transport constraints (dependent on donkey cart access and distance to fields), and labour requirements (harvest and application effort). As crop residues are vastly collected for livestock forage during the dry season, farming families in certain dryland areas are left with little sources of organic matter to regenerate soils. Innovative farmers in Burkina Faso have developed spatial and temporal shrub-crop arrangements by switching from a strategy of slash-and-burn to a strategy of slash-and-mulch to optimize services provided by in situ native woody shrub biomass (Félix, 2015). Increasingly, scientific evidence supports key roles that shrub vegetation types have in sustaining crop productivity and enhancing soil quality in the sub-region (Dossa et al., 2013; Hernandez et al., 2015; Lahmar et al., 2012; Yélémou et al., 2013). Event though woody shrub-based farming systems may have heterogeneous shrub densities, these provide soil water regulation services (Kizito et al., 2007) and nutrient provision services through organic matter from branches and leaves (Ba et al., 2014). In this context, if 100% available woody shrub biomass is the usual application by farmers as mulch, then two questions arise: (1) To what extent is crop productivity affected by in situ available mulch application? and (2) What is the effect of twice that dose of application on crop productivity?", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

These include (1) increasing the permeability of species with moderate or poor permeability; (2) incising without introducing mechanical damage to adjacent tissue; and (3) greater control of the depth of the treated zone in envelope treatments. In addition, where drying is required prior to use, it is proposed that the incisions may speed up the rate of moisture movement from the core of the wood. This preliminary study assessed the drying rate of samples of beech timber which had been incised using a CO2 laser. Weight loss over time is related to the combined action of bulk flow, diffusion in the cell lumena, diffusion through the cell wall substance, and evaporation mechanisms at the timber surface. These are discussed in the light of classical drying theory for hardwoods, to examine suitability for the industrial context.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

A standardised taxonomy to classify behaviour change techniques has been developed (Abraham & Michie, 2008). The present research aimed to refine the taxonomy further, to improve its comprehensiveness, reliability and ease of use. \n \nMethods: The taxonomy was used to code intervention descriptions in three systematic reviews by three separate groups, concerning identifying BCTs for: (a) smoking, and increasing healthy eating and physical activity, (b) behavioural interventions for obese adults, (c) increasing self-efficacy for physical activity. Each review identified problems with its use, including a lack of clarity for certain techniques and their definitions, overlap between categories and missing categories. This process of refinement was repeated iteratively by each review group, by coding intervention descriptions, discussing ambiguities and usability problems, and revising technique descriptions. \n \nFindings: We have refined the taxonomy; improving labels and definitions, and increasing the coding frame from 26 techniques to 40 techniques. Coding of intervention descriptions using later versions of the taxonomy yielded better inter-rater reliability than those found using the original version. \n \nDiscussion: We have produced an improved version of the taxonomy by resolving the problems encountered when attempting to use it in three reviews and developing the taxonomy to become more comprehensive. We recommend that researchers and other academics use this version of the taxonomy to categorise behaviour change interventions, and take a similar approach to its further development.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

In this repository setting, two main barriers existed to the return of radio-isotopes to the biosphere: the natural, or geologic and hydrogeologic barriers, and the man-made barriers. These latter comprise relatively short-lived containers as well as an engineered backfill. The backfill was designed to condition a high pH in the repository, thereby lowering the solubility of many long-lived radionuclides yet not confine gases, which might be generated from chemical and radioactive waste within the repository vault. The Environment Agency for England and Wales had already taken independent steps to examine the suitability of alkaline backfills, based on Portland cement, limestone flour and Ca(OH)2, for the man-made barriers. Preliminary data on post-closure repository performance assessment at Sellafield suggested the importance of two additional factors which had not hitherto been considered in assessments: (i) temperature: Inclusion of heat generating waste could drive temperatures up to ∼80 deg. C in the post closure phase; (ii) salinity of deep groundwater: Much previous work has been done in initially-pure water but borehole analyses indicated high salinity at depth. Other potential deep repositories could also be saline. These impacts were likely to occur together throughout much of the post-closure phase: backfills were likely to be in prolonged contact with hot, saline groundwater. Previous studies demonstrated that cements achieve their performance by a sacrificial action. It is however essential that the cementitious materials should not dissolve too rapidly if prolonged backfill performance lifetimes are to be achieved. By dissolving cement backfills condition permeating water to a high pH and thereby lower the solubilities of many radionuclides. While this conditioning action had been demonstrated to occur for initially-pure water at ∼25 deg. C, it had not been demonstrated for hot, saline solutions. Thus the performance of cements had to be addressed in hot, saline conditions, and a range of elevated temperatures, but the question was how? Many centuries, perhaps millennia, had to be compressed into a relatively brief period of laboratory assessment. It is well known that accelerated testing of materials has many pitfalls and 'performance' may not be independent of the test criteria, particularly in accelerated tests. The programme was designed to provide accelerated data but also to take into account previous relevant experience. Programme of research: aims (i) To undertake a coordinated research programme to determine the influence of saline and environments and elevated temperatures on cementitious material and backfill. (ii) To extend the capabilities of existing thermodynamic models of backfills and blended cements to encompass the range of environmental conditions likely to be experienced at proposed repository sites", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The empirical results indicate that the long planning horizon model tends to be a good predictor of observed boom-period dividends, suggesting that the boom-period dividend decision is not constrained by short or medium term predicted liquid asset levels. NYSE banks with control-theoretic boom-period dividend patterns were associated with the smaller banks, which perform financially well and display a strong share price record, as indicated by the high Tobin's Q ratio, strong dividend yield, a greater return on capital invested, higher leverage, and a smaller number of employees. The NYSE banks with observed boomperiod dividends that out-perform the control theory are associated with banks that have higher profits, as indicated by the higher return on equity, and an implied expanding customer base, as suggested by the higher revenue growth rate. Out-performing banks also have higher dividend yields, constrained by an implied internally imposed conservative retention policy, as indicated by lower payout ratios and they tend to be smaller in size.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

This book applies a media-focused transdisciplinary approach to understand the conventions of emerging digital narrative genres. Considering digital media’s impact on narrative creation and reception, the approach, namely remixed transmedia, can aid practitioners in creating strategic non-fiction narratives for cultural heritage. These creations also need to be evaluated and a digital-media focused ‘ludonarrative toolkit’ allows for the critical analysis of the composition and public participation in interactive digital narratives. This toolkit is applied and exemplified in genres including virtual museums, serious games, and interactive documentaries. The book also includes a seven-phase theoretical framework that can assist future creators (and project managers) of non-fiction transmedia ‘mothership’ narratives; and a methodology (based on ‘big data analysis’) for how to invent new cultural heritage narratives through bottom-up remixing that allows for public inclusion. Two transnational case studies on the 11 UNESCO World Heritage Australian Convict Sites and the Irish National Famine Way demonstrate the seven-phase framework’s applicability. As many scholars across disciplines are increasingly creating digital narratives on historical topics for public consumption in various forms, the theoretical foundations and practical project management framework will be useful for scholars and project teams in the domains of transmedia studies, interactive narratives, cultural heritage, media studies, comparative literature, and journalism.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Three different weights of PES powder with 1, 3, and 5 wt.% were dispersed into resin using a mechanical stirrer before being impregnated into woven basalt and glass fibre composite laminates. Eight different composite systems were fabricated and tested under tensile and flexural loading according to ASTM D3039 and D790. The result deduced that the inclusion of PES enhanced the mechanical properties for both Basalt Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (BFRP) and Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) composites. In BFRP composite systems, adding 5wt.% of PES (5BF/PES) showed the highest tensile strength and modulus with 47% and 51% increment compared to neat BFRP. In GFRP composite systems, the inclusion of 3 wt.% PES (3GF/PES) showed an improvement of 34% for tensile strength and 5wt.% PES inclusion (5GF/PES) indicated the highest improvement of tensile modulus 106% as compared to neat GFRP. For flexural strength, a similar trend of improvement was found in BFRP and GFRP composite systems. The 5BF/PES showed improvement of 148% and 121% for flexural strength and flexural modulus, compared to neat BFRP.

BEACONING is a Horizon 2020 project with 15 partners across 9 European countries, aimed at ‘Breaking Educational Barriers with Contextualised and Pervasive Gameful Learning’. The platform developed allows teachers to author desktop, mobile and location based ‘Gamified Lesson Plans’, and track the progress made by their students. Although originally intended for STEM teaching and learning with 16-24 year olds, the platform has attracted interest from teachers of other age-groups and disciplines. Coventry University, as lead partner for the BEACONING project, has conducted a number of small-scale pilots to complement the largescale pilots taking place in France, Turkey, Romania. This paper will consider the rationale, challenges and opportunities for engaging teachers and students from the University, University College, and local Secondary and Primary Schools in the pilot. The pilot protocol developed places the needs and interests of the research participants at the heart of the research process. Challenges inherent to this approach are addressed, alongside the argument that upholding agency and co-creative engagement of participants leads to valuable emergent communication that will enrich the research findings and future exploitation plans for the platform. Modes of engagement reviewed in development of the protocol include student as teacher-author, teachers as teacher-author, and researcher as author on behalf of the teacher. Gamified Lesson Plans authored during the pilot span subject areas ranging from Data Management to Modern Languages, Ancient Greece and Cookery. Methods of dissemination include play by students at desktop workstations and on mobile devices using QR (Quick Response) codes, Beacons and GPS (Global Positioning System) to customise the learning experience to chosen locations. Gamified Lesson Plans include meta-games with contrasted structures of basic, linear and interactive narrative. These meta-games are interjected with educational mini-games whose content is customised by the authoring teacher. Mini-games range from subject-specific, game specific, to generic games in which the author can extend their creativity to use a range of multimedia content for a variety of student (player) interactions. Reflecting on the development, use and evaluation of this pilot protocol, the author will consider approaches required to support the flourishing of co-creative engagement of participants and be receptive to emergent communication, whether as a single previously unheard voice, or of feedback as polyphony.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Successful national industries are based not on individual firms, but on clusters of competing firms. Creative clusters can be viewed as a sub-set of business clusters which include more than the traditional taxonomy of suppliers, providers and similar firms in close proximity to each other. Moreover, they might include a number of different actors who make up the creative economy: non-profit enterprises, cultural institutions, art venues, SMEs, and individual artists. Industries co-locate but operate and compete internationally and most of them are integrated in global supply chains. Turkish culture and creative sector is growing much faster compared to other European countries. Between 2008 and 2011 the sector has experienced a growth of 38%, where the growth rate in countries such as Spain and Italy has been below 10. Turkey has approximately 191,000 employees working in creative sector, and have generated 1.7% of the total employment in 2011. The creative industry clusters are mostly concentrated in Istanbul and Ankara, with the film industry being the largest contributor to the economy estimated to be worth around 400 million Euros in 2008. However, there is still limited knowledge related to the composition of the creative sector in Turkey and how they are integrated into global supply chains. This paper suggests a methodology to analyse how the creative industries in Turkey are embedded into national and international supply chains, drawing from the methodologies that have been widely used in the United Kingdom, therefore, providing a framework of analysis that can be used by researchers to further expand the knowledge in this area. The framework can be equally applied by scholars or governmental organizations with the purpose of measuring the impact of the actions and policies aimed at developing and strengthening the creative clusters in Turkey.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Chapter three is a systematic review considering the state of the literature on how child maltreatment is being defined and identified in Asia. This review identified relatively a dearth of literature; hence chapters four to six qualitatively explore how different stakeholders (i.e., professionals, parents and adult survivors of child maltreatment respectively) perceive child maltreatment in relation to their cultural beliefs, values and parenting practices. The findings suggested that culture may influence how child maltreatment is perceived and what is considered as abusive parenting behaviour. Chapter 7 explores how ecological factors and how cultural factors such as beliefs, perception and cultural assimilation are related to how child maltreatment is being perceived.

This, in particular, has created difficulties in identifying valid measurement tools to appraise their creation and deployment leading to the extant literature to rely upon qualitative, often longitudinal, case studies to analyse the phenonoma (Wang and Ahmed, 2007, Barreto, 2010, Eriksson, 2014). There is, eventually, limited empirical evidence available that examines the influences of dynamic capabilities have on the competitive advantage and firms performance, specially, under the impact of gender diversity of management teams. Literature: Dynamic capabilities are defined as “the firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments” (Teece et al., 1997, p. 516). In doing so they create value, derived from the capacity of a management team to identify opportunities and threats and reconfigure a firm’s repertoire of resources and operations to address them (Teece, 2007). Upper Echelons theory has suggested that the decisions of management teams which significantly influences firms’ performance is consistent with the teams’ cognitive or executive orientations (Finkelstein and Hambrick 1996; Hambrick and Mason 1984). Such managerial approaches determine the ways in how management teams gather, filter and interpret information related to business environment, as well as how to response to environmental changes (Finkelstein and Hambrick 1996; Hambrick 2007). Extant literature has shown that the proportion of women in management teams changes such managerial activities, considered as key components of dynamic capabilities, which in turn positively influence firms’ performance. Approach: This study employs an internet-based survey to explore the dynamic capabilities of management teams, competitive advantage and performance of 274 SMEs in the UK. This study is distinct from previous research as it employs a quantitative method and constructs a new multidimensional dynamic capability measurement by aggregating definitions, analysis and suggestions from previous literature to establish and test hypotheses (Teece, 2014). This measurement is validated by using the confirmatory factor analysis method before being utilized to examine a research framework. To measure the competitive advantage and performance of SMEs, this study employs measurements adopted and validated by extant research (Pisano and Wheelwright, 1995; Hill and Jones, 2007; Wu, Wang, Tseng, and Wu, 2009; and Lumpkin and Dess, 2001). This study’s analysis entails a three-stage approach; a measurement model using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine the validity and reliability of measurements, a structural model to test the relationships among latent variables (Byrne, 2010), and a multigroup structural equation modelling to compare the male-dominant and non-male-dominant models. Findings: The results indicate support for hypotheses in which the dynamic capabilities of management teams has a significantly positive influence on competitive advantage, which in turn, enhances the performance of SMEs. The multigroup SEM analysis reveals that, within SMEs led by non-male-dominant teams, the dynamic capabilities have a significantly positive influence on firm’s performance, but this significantly link is not hold in the cases of SMEs led by male-dominant management teams. Values: This study examines the influence that the dynamic capabilities of management teams had upon the competitive advantage and performance of SMEs. We build on insights into the antecedents of dynamic capabilities in the context of gender diversity of management teams to addresses a fundamental: How the gender diversity of management teams changes the effects of dynamic capabilities had on SME’s competitive advantage and performance. The results from this study also helps to clarify a controversy over the relationship between dynamic capabilities and a firm’s performance.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The flow station object of the present assessment handles a daily production of 25MBPD and over 38MMSCF. Crude oil production goes through a separation process before the gas is compressed to be further used in gas lift wells. The gas plant integrates two compressing chains with three compressors each, which increase the gas pressure from 50psi to 2500psi by means of three compression stages. For over 9 years there has been evidence of detonations within the reciprocating compressors body, which has forced their shutdown during evening hours, leading to the decrease of the oil production from associated wells and important risks to the working personnel due to the presence of a flammable atmosphere. PDVSA INTEVEP coordinated environmental and health inspections in the area surrounding the compression plant and flow station, allowing for the delimitation of further process evaluation in order to diagnose the root cause of the compressor detonations. From the inspections, it was possible to identify the causes of the increased flammability in the evening hours, as well as the origin of the gas mixture that enriched the atmosphere surrounding the compression plant. Further process evaluation within the flow station allowed for the identification of uneven flow distribution to separator vessels, as well as underestimated vessels capacity and inadequate instrumentation configuration that originated deficiencies within the separation process causing gas to be carried under towards the liquid handling facilities.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The study was intended to explore the potential for biomechanics to contribute towards our understanding of good and bad body positioning in relation to horticultural activities in order to minimise injury risks. Significant numbers of people engage in gardening as a popular pastime or are employed in the wider horticultural industry (landscaping, etc). Gardening has been described as a moderately rigorous form of exercise and the musculoskeletal demands of gardening are considered substantial. These factors have led to an increased interest in the use of gardening as a form of exercise and a health intervention. However, it is noted that the risk of injury associated with physical exercise in general is of concern and it is considered that this injury risk can be extended into professional and amateur horticulturalists undertaking a variety of gardening tasks. Horticulture is suitable for analysis where the primary objective may be injury avoidance and increasing the efficiency of the horticulturalists undertaking gardening tasks.  Abnormal patterns of gardening movement may be self-sustaining and reinforced over time by repetition and be the cause of potential injury risk. It is known that muscle fatigue reduces the force capabilities of a muscle and that excessive force magnitudes and/or repetitious forces may surpass the capacity and recovery limits of muscles which may result in fatigue or injury. The digging movement of horticulturists was measured using a 3-dimensional motion capture system and all the data collected was analysed using Biomechanics of Bodies (BoB) analysis code written in MATLAB.  The joint angle time histories of the horticulturists were calculated from the motion capture data and used to articulate a musculoskeletal model of the subjects. The joint torques were calculated using inverse dynamics methods from which the individual muscle loads were established using a cost function minimisation approach. Finally the joint contact forces were calculated including the muscle forces. The motion capture data of digging trials were observed by a team of horticulturalists and physiotherapist who identified trials demonstrating good and bad practice. It was found that the joint torques and contact forces, and their variability, were lower in the trials which were identified as good practice than those displaying bad practice.

The on-screen representations and relationships between the family are crucial to a dialogue surrounding how the silver screen continues to frame UK working-class life. The autobiographical narrative reinforces many of the brutal truths regarding poverty amongst the working classes during Thatcher’s Britain, but Ray & Liz also offers much more. This article will examine the ways in which the film de-centralizes a patriarchal perspective positioning Liz as the looming matriarchal figure, whilst also looking at how Ray & Liz questions the ability of any one in this world to change their own destiny within the landscape they find themselves. Key readings of the film offered in this article consider its relationship with not only motherhood on-screen but also how complex understandings of masculinity underpin the debates that Ray & Liz offers its audience. Secondly, the article will look critically at the poetry that Billingham brings to the cinematic language and how the lens, sound and overall space echoes his talents as a master photographer. Through his images of family life, he brings us a punishing yet beautiful on-screen commentary that is full of complexity and important observations regarding working-class issues, matriarchy, motherhood and masculinity.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

People have a collection of wants and needs and a significant proportion of them are to do with their requirements for mobility. The authors show how creative designers can take a user-focused approach for a wide range of types of transport products and systems. In so doing their starting point is one of creative dissatisfaction with what is currently available, and their specialist capability is in imagining and developing new solutions which respond to that opportunity. How this is tackled varies depending on the context, and the variety of solutions produced reflects the different aspirations and needs of the people they are designing for. The chapters cover user needs and transport, design and the transport system, transport design case studies, and the case for the automobile. A conclusion briefly signals what the future for transport design might be.

The theoretical perspective of the research is backed by the new wave of feminism or moderate feminism. As Schippers and Sapp (2012 suggested about understanding of the third wave of feminism within the context of inequality and difference rather than as an issue of individual choice available to women as a source of confidence and empowerment. The filed of enquiry is the public limited and private limited companies in Bangladesh with the study drawing on qualitative research. The researchers interviewed 40 male and female professionals (managers and senior managers) working in the public and private limited companies in Bangladesh. The interviewees provided rich qualitative data. The analysis of the data helped in bringing out the appropriate scenario of women in the organisations of Bangladesh practicing more of moderate feminism. Moreover, the issues were identified that effect the practice of feminism by women. The findings also suggested that women managers still face discrimination and find themselves at disadvantaged position in the organisations of Bangladesh and therefore, the information will enable the policy makers and management team to review their strategies and trainings and redesign accordingly to promote women empowerment. This paper examines an area of gendered leadership in corporate governance that is underexplored in public and private companies and is particularly valuable to women professionals in these companies. However, the scope extend to all other organisation managers/leaders who seek to improve the aspects of their corporate governance activities to employ best talents available in the country irrespective of their gender and promote women empowerment.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

This paper examines how society can be a facilitator yet also a barrier for female social housing residents in forming the third step of a tailored entrepreneurship support program delivered by the housing association to its female housing residents. From this, a theoretical framework was developed through which two categories are derived, with several variables. Prior work: This paper is the fourth instalment in a series of studies, which builds upon previous work that examined the entrepreneurship discipline, amongst its subsects; female entrepreneurship, ethnic minority entrepreneurship and the long established, continual gender debate (Marlow 1997; Bruni et al., 2004; Ahl 2006; Jones 2010; 2012; Narayanasamy et al., 2011; Pathak et al. 2013). Overall it was found that entrepreneurship is fragmented and ununified (Keating and Higgins, 2016; Audretsch et al., 2007); demonstrated by the lack of an unambiguous definition of entrepreneurship i.e. Schumpeter (1934), Brazeal and Herbert (1999), Alvarez and Barney (2007), Short et al. (2010); Narayanasamy et al. (2011) all provide differing definitions of entrepreneurship. Baudaeu (1771) cited in Grebel et al. (2003), Schumpeter (1934), Palmer (1971), Schwartz (1976), Khan (1986), Bull and Willard (1993), Aldrich and Martinez (2001), Grebel et al. (2003), Nijkamp (2003), Rae, (2004a), Ahl (2006), Roomi et al. (2009) and Marlow and Swail (2014). Method: The analysis applies Corbin’s Constructivist grounded theory as it is recognised that research cannot be conducted without prejudgment, Charmaz (2008) emphasises that these preconceptions cannot be dismissed. Acknowledging this enabled open interpretation to take place throughout the study. The data was collected through traditional storytelling aided with semi-structured interviews and open-ended questions to discover new understandings of entrepreneurship (Rae, 2000) through natural enquiry; as people deliberate through narratives (Graham et al., 2015). Five data sets were used to inform the results of this paper: 1.) social-housing residents’ longitudinal interviews, 2.) a successful entrepreneur and housing association resident 3.) a UK housing association (and critical research partner) interviews and case study, 4.) Housing association stakeholder key-informants for example: local community organisations, and 5.) researcher observations collected throughout the study. Findings: The findings were formed based upon practice-based theory (Rae, 2004a) in the construction of an emerging model of the Societal Effect, which categorises the variables under two groups: facilitators of entrepreneurship and barriers to entrepreneurship. The model is derived from each dataset examining the role of each variable. Originality/value: This paper seeks to contribute to research on social housing residents, where there is little to none existing studies; as previous research on housing associations gives precedence to them as organisations only. The emerging model of the Societal Effect seeks to narrow this gap through the understanding of heterogenous societal impacts in enabling or hindering entrepreneurial activity upon female social housing residents. This paper’s main innovation addresses both micro level entrepreneurship, through the provision of the third step in entrepreneurship support provision with a specific focus on society, and meso level such as institutions for business support and changing ecosystems.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

For Arendt she had been someone 'in' a language not just 'with' a language. This unique choice of preposition, 'in' and not 'with', forms the title of this book and testifies to centrality of language in our lives. Language is our DNA in effect. It may seem strange then to publish a book on language through a series of images and photographs but in many ways life is just that strangeness. We juxtapose the linguistic with the visual and interpret the visual through the linguistic. Life is a constant shift between the on-stage and off-stage performance which this book enacts. In some way the paradox is always with us even though we like to think we can see through it. The paradox is left firmly in place here for you to appreciate the beauty of the duality as it stands—it won’t always be there for you. The book is a photo essay of fifty three sumptuous spreads in full colour narrated and interpreted through a series of inspirational quotes from the author’s recent work 'It’s Language Stupid: unravelling the DNA of the mind'—a defence of nonrepresentational linguistic idealism. The quotes, either in original form or suitably modified, all attest to key junctures in the passages which are deserving of further consideration: a reminder that we need to get off the bus, so to speak, and look around (there is someone else with us on our journey). In some cases, quotes from prominent philosophers and idealists are presented. For each quote on the verso folio, an image and arrangement on the recto is presented. The spread is meant to be taken as one and further subdivision should not be contemplated. Well-known artists such as Van Gogh and William Blake are presented along with less familiar names such as Hiroaki Takahashi and the inimitable RANT 73.

With novel approaches being identified to  increase student engagement and enhance their learning experience. Every learning individual is different, and Project Management as a discipline is no different, although encounters major challenges when being delivered to students from  diverse backgrounds and experiences. Much literature had discussed the use of gamification concepts to facilitate educational delivery and enhancement. In line with pedagogical literature, this paper explores a novel approach adopted within Coventry  University, wherein the students were tasked with applying their project management knowledge to the development of a  Project Management educational game. This allowed them to apply their knowledge to the developmental process, through an  experiential learning approach. Not only this, but as these students were learners themselves, they were able to infuse the  game with what they deemed suitable for their learning style, leading to the development of a project management educational game that tailors for different learners, embeds gamification and engagement concepts and imparts the knowledge required. This paper looks at the approach adopted, the milestones achieved by the students, the learning experience encountered and how the challenges that were encountered were overcome, with a case study of Postgraduate students. Thus challenging the status quo in terms of delivery of Project Management educational experience through a novel approach where the students acquired new skill sets along the way, while applying their knowledge of Project management principles to the project at hand, while critically reflecting on their knowledge as they develop the game to educate and challenge potential learners while imparting this knowledge upon them", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Typical manufacturing knowledge bases are designed for populated knowledge only and do not support capturing and reasoning over Meta level knowledge. Modelling to capture Meta level knowledge has been investigated in broader software community but the same is not true in manufacturing domain particularly in process planning. Moreover, an exploration to capture and reason about such knowledge in formal manufacturing ontologies has not been conducted. In this paper, a new formal ontology is proposed to capture meta level production methods. The ontology makes use of “powertypes” and “clabjects” to treat classes as objects. Meta level production methods can be captured using the proposed ontology. Manufacturability of features within a part family can be found at the meta level.

Natural ingredients in food products are everywhere continually gaining popularity, and the use of plant extracts in cosmetic formulations are on the rise. Additionally, chemists, pharmacists and nutritionists are focusing on the development of new nutritional applications that target not only to disease prevention but also in improving skin health, appearance of the food product and overcoming any off flavors. This approach is the beginning of the new era where the products intended to promote well-being and health will be available to meet the consumers’ demands. Polyphenols are the most abundant natural antioxidants in nature commonly found in both edible and non-edible parts of plants, and they have been reported to have multiple biological effects, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activities. The extraction of polyphenols from plant sources has drawn increasing attention as a low-value source of antioxidants. Although the development in analytical techniques has played a significant role in the detection of a wide range of polyphenols, success still depends on the method of extraction. In literature, several combinations of solvent, temperature, extraction time and agitation speed have been presented in order to achieve maximum phenolic yields, but these conventional proposals are considered as burden on the environment due to the use of high temperatures for long periods of time and secondly due to the effect on the heat-sensitive components of polyphenols. Alternatively, the application of novel techniques such as ultrasound, pulsed electrical field, high-pressure CO2 and others is more welcoming due to their reduced usage of organic solvents, low operational temperatures, short processing times and better quality and yields with high selectivity toward targeted compounds. The extracts rich in phenolic compounds are attractive ingredients for food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products due to their beneficial biological properties importantly their antioxidant potential.

Women have now progressed to boardroom in organisations proving their efficiency (Krishnan and Parson, 2008; Gul et al., 2011, Srinidhi et al., 2011; Post and Byron, 2014). Researchers have confirmed positive relationship between women on board of directors and CSR (Wang and Coffey, 1992; Williams, 2003; Bear et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2013; Setó‐Pamies, 2015). The percentage of women in senior management teams is found 25% in 2017 globally (IBR, 2017). However, there is a growing trend of adopting moderate feminism where individuated subject recognises the persistence of gender inequalities but perceives the solution to inequality as dependent on individual action (Rottenberg, 2014). Researchers started to realise the importance of institution (Mahoney, 2005) and its impact on feminism movement and company performances. The institutional perspective is that while institutions are not homogeneous, are under social influence and pressure to adopt and be consistent with institutional environment and can be defined as ‘‘regulative, normative, and cognitive structures and activities that provide stability and meaning to social behaviour’’ (Scot, 1995). North (1990, p.3) defined institutions as ‘‘the humanly devised constraints that structure human interaction’’. This makes institutional setting to be considered essential to explore its effect on feminism to reduce negative effects on firm performances.  The relationship between institutional settings and feminism in a framework of institutional theory have not been explored and possess a gap in the literature. The study sets out to establish the relationship between institutional settings, moderate feminism and firm performances through critical review of existing literature and providing a conceptual framework for future empirical research.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The high profile and populism of the field with mainstream press and celebrities often sees mindfulness as the panacea for modern ills such as stress and mental health issues. In this workshop we will highlight how the two main approaches, reflective mindfulness and mindful learning, can be applied to business and management disciplines to develop the field. Criticisms from academia are made as to the quality and rigor of research into the benefits of mindfulness interventions. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together delegates with an interest in researching mindfulness within organisations, not only as an intervention to wellbeing but also other domains of management such as training, leadership, change management and decision making. We will provide practical activities guiding participants through mindfulness intervention techniques from both wellbeing and mindful learning perspectives. An exploration of ways to raise the bar of management research into mindfulness will help ameliorate the critique over methods employed, and unpack the active ingredients of interventions. The ultimate aim for the future is to push good quality mindfulness research into higher ranking journals as well as have practical implications on organisations.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

While this helped to consolidate knowledge about women’s engagement in economic activities, it also highlighted the need for new directions to capture the ‘heterogeneity’ of the composition of women’s entrepreneurship. This paper explores the overlapping domains of women’s entrepreneurship and family businesses. The literature on family businesses increasingly highlights the invisibility of women and a paradox where women’s engagement in entrepreneurial activity (as joint owners/partners in family businesses) is increasing at an exponential rate, yet women remain economically disenfranchised. Design/methodology/approach: This research paper adopts a micro-sociological approach, focusing on symbolic interactionism to consider micro concepts such as gender, social class, and economic empowerment/independence in Nigeria's context of family businesses. Findings: The findings reveal that women’s engagement in a family business (especially in patriarchal societies) is largely sacrificial. Their motivation for taking up positions in the family business is the ‘family good’ and not self-actualisation. Originality: Given the need for progressive and complementary additive studies that connect and build upon previous works on family-run enterprises, this paper explores the overlapping domains of Women's Economic Empowerment (WEE) and family businesses. Research limitations: Due to the nature of patriarchal societies and the promotion of gender inequality in such societies, research focusing on other cultural contexts is advisable. Research implication: This paper suggests that understanding the culture of unpaid wages in family-owned businesses where women’s participation is not voluntary but expected could help reimagine and redefine the Women Economic Empowerment (WEE) agenda.

The first design model is a single duct single pass, in which air flows underneath the PV panel and the upper surface of PV subject to ambient conditions. The second is similar to the first one, but with an air gap added between the upper surface of the PV module and glass cover. In the third, air flows under and over the surfaces of the PV module in the same direction. The fourth is similar to the third one, but the flow pathways are in opposite direction. In the fifth, air flows between the glass cover and the PV module and reverses in the second pass between the PV panel and lower absorber plate, making a U-shape flow. The fifth model displays the best thermal performance whilst the third offers the highest electrical efficiency.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

This paper presents 1-D CFD simulation using Ricardo WAVE of 30 % downsizing on a 2.0 litre naturally aspirated spark ignition engine to a 1.4 litre turbocharged gasoline direct injection variable valve timing engine. Performance improvement has been achieved by using turbocharging and variable valve technology. Turbocharging a spark ignition engine increases the intake temperature and pressure, causing the mixture to detonate. To prevent engine mixture detonation, direct injection has been used, which also allows an increase in the compression ratio. The downsized engine has been optimised for maximum volumetric efficiency, maximum brake mean effective pressure and knock elimination. Valve opening timing, their durations and lifts have been optimised to improve volumetric efficiency. Fuel-air ratio and start of injection timing have also been optimised to improve the maximum brake mean effective pressure.

These chains will be more sustainable, and should be commercially more efficient, than road-only transport. Motorways of the sea will thus improve access to markets throughout Europe, and bring relief to the over-stretched European road system . The design concept presented in this paper is a high speed vessel to compete with road transport and air transport, supported by specialised infrastructure to optimise the vessel loading and unloading process for cars and HGVs. \nThe vessel design combines the following functions: high speed ferry as an alternative to HGV road transport; passenger ferry as a alternative to flights; luxury cruising cabins. It is based on a 120m trimaran platform designed to operate at 40 knots as a coastal cruiser in the Mediterranean, connecting the coast of Spain, France and Italy. This project is an engagement in Design-Driven Innovation (DDI), with the objective of changing the design meaning of what a multi-purpose commercial vessel can be, proposing the CLF as a new market sector for the commercial marine industry. The key driver is sustainable luxury, as the vessel is multifunctional, providing a high speed alternative to less sustainable modes of transport. This addresses the growing European definition of green luxury and could create a new market sector between cruise ships and high end passenger ferries, reducing motorway traffic and hence logistics carbon footprint.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Examining the incitements to digitalize feminism in the neoliberal context, the paper examines how an emergent technology of confidence re-signifies feminist accounts by situating feminist visibility and misogynist responses to feminism systematically. The paper diagnoses the current speculation of digital feminism in relation to wider debates about feminism, public feminism as digitalised culture and how this opens up new possibilities and associated new challenges.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The objective of Industrial Design is to study both function and form, and the\nconnection between product, the user and the operational environment. The role of an Industrial Designer is to create\nand execute design solutions for problems of form, usability and human factors. Although the design process may be\nconsidered 'creative', it has a structured workflow involving many analytical processes, and is generally executed by an\ninterdisciplinary team. Many industrial designers use design methodologies, such as User Centred Design, in their\ncreative process.\nThis paper examines the potential of Industrial Design to address the physical and environmental demands to which\nNorth Sea oil and gas personnel are exposed. The physical stressors that must be considered in the design process\ninclude noise reduction; lighting for circadian adaption and enhanced environment experience; improved workspace\ndesign; improved recreation facility design; air quality issues relating to the positive pressure environment; and the risk\nof musculo-skeletal disorders (MSD) associated with cramped workspace, awkward postures, and steep staircases.\nCultural differences between FPSO and fixed platform crew are examined in term of user needs within the distinctive\ndesign scenarios. As space is costly on offshore installations, good design can potentially make the most of the limited\nspace available; several design proposals are reviewed in this context. Possible commonality with physical and\nenvironmental stressors in the offshore wind farm sector are identified, and extrapolated into future far shore wind farm\noperational scenarios.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Le Guin`s A Wizard of Earthsea(1968), which is the first part of Earthsea Trilogy in the frame of Taoism and Jungian theories such as shadow and wholeness. Although Taoism is a transcendental philosophy whose doctrine is not systematically organised, its main goal is to understand the state of Tao, the flow of the universe. The values of Taoism such as self-control and non-action are repeatedly taught as Ged learns magic. In the context of Taoism and Jungian theories, this essay defines the unknown enemy as the Jungian shadow and the education Ged as a young magic student receives Taoist lessons of silence and non-action. This research is divided into four parts: background to fiction and the author, Jungian shadow and Taoist balance shown in the fiction, the mythopoetic narrative, and characteristics of a Bildungsroman, or a coming-of-age novel. The plot of the novel follows structures of the epic narrative which is seen in Homer or Virgil. Although it follows the epic structure, Ged is not depicted as a super hero, but rather anti-hero whose adventure is not initiated by personal glory or honour, but by his mistake and ignorance. In this essay, Ged`s struggle to discover the true identity of his enemy - and also his - is considered as a psychic journey to achieve the Jungian/Taoist wholeness, and at the same it is considered that Ged made a successful transformation from adolescence into adulthood.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

We argue that a dialogic, embodied approach to M&A process research utilising a restorying antenarrative approach is key to unlocking aliveness and temporality which are much needed to invigorate M&A ‘process’ research. To a large extent, research done on M&A has utilised a reductionist approach where pre and post acquisition phases are taken to be separate parts. We argue that this reductionist\napproach does not resonate well with process research as it does not enable researchers gain access to the flow, flux and temporality during M&A in the making; the interrelationships between the two phases or how these phases inform one another. Additionally, most M&A process research has utilized a monologic approach where the author has had the final say and findings are presented as 'dead' stuff. The very term process means 'flow' flux, aliveness.\nWe argue that the field is in need of a dialogic and more ethical approach to M&A process research, one where other voices are heard and where temporality takes precedence over end states. Furthermore, we argue that there is need for an embodied approach with the understanding that the primordial kind of knowing is the one grounded in our actions and not in our cognition. Taking action on possibilities is not rooted in a conscious move where we analyse and take cognizance of the situation (Heidegger 1962); instead actions are already\npart of the situation as being-in-the-world.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Traditional metrics of human performance can of course provide us with a great deal of insight as to the mechanics of an operator controlling an unmanned system, with situation awareness and mental workload being the two primary cognitive factors that rise to the top of the Human Factors list of concerns. However, as we move forward in UAS we are seeing a technology and operational shift towards small unmanned systems, and in turn a slow demand for the release of the line of sight constraint for communication. In order to achieve true beyond line of sight operations it is imperative that the UAS possesses a high degree of automation, and in some instances allow the human to delegate different levels of authority. As the operator releases direct flight inputs to the aircraft, and in some cases to multiple aircraft, the argument for applying good Human Factors design to the command and control elements of the system will focus less on alleviating mental workload on the operator, but rather supplying an operator with the right information in order to continue safe control of the aircraft under his/her control. This presentation will outline the importance of situational awareness and mental workload, but focus more on the more pressing issue that modern UAS will impose; that of human vigilance.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Ballard`s 1973 novel Crash is discussed to define `desire to be seen` in Deleuzian control societies where `to be seen` provides modern human beings with more power than `to see.` In discipline societies, visibility was a trap, but in control societies, to be forgotten is what modern human beings are most afraid of. In control societies, the more a person is seen, the more power s/he has. In Crash, Ballard describes modern human beings` desperate desire to be seen through the heroes` designing for their own death and recording crash sites. Vaughan`s desire to be seen in the most famous crash is related to modern control societies for two reasons. First, in control societies where every social factor is controlled, the only way human beings enjoy freedom is ironically to submit to the social control in order to become famous revealing more personal information, because this makes them more visible, therefore, more powerful. Second, after the development of media technology such as TV, films or the Internet, modern human beings are likely to consider reality as cinematic images and see themselves as part of films, thus, they try to provide dramatic images to the public and get the public gaze instead. Thus, modern people inevitably become slaves of the optic. Ballard shows, through Vaughan`s failure to die with Elizabeth Taylor, that the dream to be famous in control societies is hard to achieve and even meaningless. However, the author contrasts ordinary people, who gather to see the crash site, with Vaughan, who causes the crash. These contrasting images suggest some hope in Vaughan who enjoys the maximum freedom, while majority of modern human beings in control societies passively desire to see his crash.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

We propose a conceptual framework that portrays forgiveness as the underlying process in the relationship between the service provider type and repurchase intentions.

One such issue is the importance of women’s healthcare in the Middle East. In a region of the world where personal modesty often takes precedent over appropriate healthcare being sought, the global recognition of the importance of early diagnosis of breast cancer being important in its effective treatment is having an impact on how the global community addresses regional customs in the case of globally relevant issues. Despite significant medical advances in the management of breast cancer, there remain many barriers which are limiting the ability to further develop early diagnosis and treatment of the disease from a global perspective. An earlier case-based study had drawn attention to social and cultural difficulties in the healthcare system within a Middle Eastern diaspora particularly due to delays in early detection and timely treatment of breast cancer. Following the identification of the main causes underlying delays in breast cancer detection, corrective measures to establish an efficient management system enabled the transformation of societal and cultural disadvantages into opportunities for positive change. Consequently, in an effort to minimise delays and reduce rising mortality figures in the Arab World, a breast cancer management plan was proposed. This paper thus addresses the process to introduce much needed improvement in the healthcare industry in the Arab World, by examining breast cancer management in the region, with a focus on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a potential model for change in the broader Middle East and Islamic World.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Its protagonist and narrator Patrick Bateman represents New York yuppies in the 1980s and this article defines him as a portrait of modern human beings living in a performance society. A performance society is a society, which Byung-Chul Han, in his book Müdigkeitsgesellschaft, labels one of the main characteristics of modern society. This research focuses on the problems of Bateman’s identity and finds the causes of his identity crisis in modern performance society, the phenomenon of depersonalisation and consumerism. In a performance society, to be distinguished oneself from others is crucial for survival. Materials are effective tools to differentiate oneself from others because they clearly show the owner’s social status and wealth. The problem here is that quality of people is replaced with the personal status and wealth. As people try to individualise themselves with designers’ goods and with subtle details, ironically depersonalisation catches up individualisation. In addition, when quality of people is decided by what they have, not what they are, everyone becomes replaceable with each other. Bateman is often misunderstood as someone else by his colleagues or attorney, but since he does not have any identity, names do not matter for him. His sense of self lies on brand names not his name. Bateman’s personal relationship has also changed into display relationship as seen on the friends’ list of a social networking system such as Facebook.

This is further exacerbated due to multiplicity of theoretical models that identify KPIs applicable to a particular industry. However, these models do not give these industries the independence to set their own criteria or guide their decision making. Decision making processes for procurement or business area growth can be quite time consuming and is complicated due to the multiple criteria inherent within, which are further complicated during VUCA conditions. As an approach to resolve this, this paper discusses an interactive mathematical tool using modified FAHP based calculation to aid in organizational decision making. This is through suggesting the most sustainable option a supply chain organization can implement based on the multiple criteria and options available to that organization during VUCA times (e.g., COVID-19). This model gives the user/organization the independence to set their own criteria and is not based on a pre-defined list of theoretical KPIs to choose from. Three different case studies have been applied to the MCDA model and the results have been verified with actual decisions made.

Contacts were established with professors and researchers of all Portuguese institutions with tourism higher education degrees, who were asked to disseminate the survey among former graduates. IBM SPSS Statistics (v.19) was used to perform the statistical analysis. Univariate and bivariate statistical techniques were applied, through exploratory and inferential methods, and a 5% level of significance was adopted. Female tourism graduates’ self-perceptions confirm that women tend to enhance their professional performance and leadership skills. Thus, data suggest that self-perceptions and self-confidence cannot explain gender differences in leadership positions. Since women’s self-perceptions are not self-imposed barriers to their career development, as claimed by some authors, the need to unveil the reasons, inherent to the observed gender gap, is advocated. The value of this study relies on the demystification of women’s selfperceptions as negative and inferior comparatively to their counterparts.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

At the same time, the storage of this harnessed heat into phase change materials (PCMs), would decouple demand and supply unlike commercially available harnessing techniques. A counter-flow heat exchanger embedded in an appropriate PCM, within the sewage lines of conventional buildings would recover this otherwise lost energy. However due to the limited thermal conductivity of PCMs, passive heat transfer enhancement techniques are necessary both internal and external of the heat exchanger pipes. The use of corrugated pipes compared to simple pipes is quite effective to serve this purpose, especially when coupled with this application of harnessing waste heat. These pipes enhance internal turbulence within the pipe, the surface area of contact and guide the flowing fluid along the circumferential length of the pipe to enhance the overall heat transfer coefficient. Additionally, these pipes also have a doubly enhancing effect, in which heat transfer is improved on the external surface. An experimental model is used to validate a 3D numerical simulation of this corrugated pipe GW-PCM problem. Temperature readings of the three different components of the system are used to validate the simulation developed in the CFD software Star-CCM v12.04. The overall average percentage errors between the two are below 8.5% for the 15-minute duration with results during the steady state time period being in much closer agreement. This numerical simulation would serve as the basis of a future sensitivity analysis to discover the dimensional parameters of a corrugated pipe delivering optimum results within this application.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The development of a stenosis is modelled based on the blood flow; and the subsequent changes in the flow are examined. The model is applied to investigate the role of different haemodynamic markers on stenosis development and also the importance of modelling the non-Newtonian nature of the blood. A stenosis growth model based on the time-averaged velocity magnitude at the wall is considered. The wall position where this marker has a minimum value is determined and the stenosis is allowed to develop at this point. The extent to which the stenosis develops is controlled by two parameters which are introduced. Simulations are then run based on the new geometry and a new position selected for stenosis development. The stenosis developed in this way was seen to be compatible with observations from the literature. Simulations of stenosis development are presented to investigate the effect of the introduced model parameters to determine suitable ranges for their application. A range of parameters are determined over which the stenosis develops in an independent manner. These parameters relate the extent to which the stenosis can grow in each development phase with no physical significance. It is important to find a variable which will describe the evolution in a manner which is independent of the model parameters. As well as the time-averaged velocity magnitude, a selection of alternative markers were applied to the model. The results show that a number of markers involving near-wall velocity, wall shear stress, residential time, stagnation index and second invariant of the strain rate tensor, all resulted in a realistic stenosis. The oscillatory shear index, which gives a measure of the oscillatory nature of the shear, was found to not be a suitable marker, unless it was combined with the wall shear stress in the form of a ratio. The effect of the non-Newtonian nature of blood on the stenosis development model is also considered. Here the non-Newtonian simulation showed noticeable differences compared to Newtonian; however both produced a realistic stenosis.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The arguments herein move beyond the traditional analysis of “cause and effect” relationships while addressing “crises” in its different forms. The study tries to map out the crises which are reinforced by the ruling class in India since decades in the process of identity formations based on race, religion, caste and culture in politics and dismantling the role of state in economy through the process of market led reforms. The crisis is again reinforced by the given political economy of the Indian society where masses have to sacrifice their development for the pleasure of others. Instead of solving these acute problems, the Indian ruling class tries to overcome it by diverting people from the real life issues through the process of spreading the venom of communalism and other emotive issues. The society and culture is being shaped by the economy, and economics does not lead politics rather it follows politics. Thus, it is necessary precondition to shape politics for the better economy that works for the masses. Apart from the market based advocacy, the ruling class in India also advocates for the technology and information. Of course, we need technology but till now it is in the hands of the few and far away from the masses. An understanding about crises and its reinforcing agencies will be essential for all future struggles for alternatives.

The data collected were used to adapt the technology acceptance model and was tested using structural equation modelling. Findings – The results revealed that usefulness and ease of use of online corporate reporting have a significant effect on the extent to which users rely on corporate websites in making their investment decisions. Furthermore, most information content items are found to have a positive direct effect on the extent to which users find corporate websites useful. Regarding accessibility, search items are found to have a positive direct effect on the extent to which users find corporate websites easy to use, but not utilisation items. Research limitations/implications – In addition to limitations inherent in the questionnaire method, this study examined one group of users (professional and private investors) whose perceptions might differ from other users groups.

The experimental test case is\nthe Delft JHC burner to study Mild combustion; a clean combustion concept. In this burner, CH4\nbased fuel has been enriched from 0 to 25% of H2. Since the main stabilization mechanism of\nthese turbulent flames is autoignition, the developed numerical model should be able to predict\nthis complex event. Furthermore, addition of hydrogen makes modeling even more challenging\ndue to its preferential diffusion effects. These effects are increasingly important since autoignition\nis typically initiated at very small mixture fractions where molecular diffusion is comparable\nto turbulence transport (eddy viscosity). In this study, first, a novel numerical model is developed\nbased on the Flamelet Generated Manifolds (FGM) to account for preferential diffusion effects in\nautoignition.

Safety is aimed at protecting the systems from accidental failures in order to avoid hazards, while security is focused on protecting the systems from intentional attacks. They share identical goals - protecting CPS from failing. When aligned within a CPS, safety and security work well together in providing a solid foundation of an invincible CPS, while weak alignment may produce inefficient development and partially-protected systems. The need of such alignment has been recognized by the research community, the industry, as well as the International Society of Automation (ISA), which identified a need of alignment between safety and security standards ISA84 (IEC 61511) and ISA99 (IEC 62443). We propose an approach for aligning CPS safety and security at early development phases by synchronizing safety and security lifecycles based on ISA84 and ISA99 standards. The alignment is achieved by merging safety and security lifecycle phases, and developing an unified model - Failure-Attack-CounTermeasure (FACT) Graph. The FACT graph incorporates safety artefacts (fault trees and safety countermeasures) and security artefacts (attack trees and security countermeasures), and can be used during safety and security alignment analysis, as well as in later CPS development and operation phases, such as verification, validation, monitoring, and periodic safety and security assessment.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

In order for a material to act as stabilizer, its impact on soil settlement characteristics must be investigated. Hence, this research investigated the influence of bone ash stabilizer on the settlement characteristics of soil. Two soil samples were collected from two locations within Ibadan metropolis Nigeria. Bone ash was prepared from calcination of cattle bones at a temperature of 1100ÂC in electric furnace. After grinding, the ash was added to the collected soil samples in varying proportions by dry weight (3%, 5%, 7%, 10%, 15% and 20%) in order to determine the compressibility behaviour of the soil at different proportions of bone ash. The settlement characteristics investigated were compression index, coefficient of consolidation, preconsolidation pressure, coefficient of area and volume compressibility and initial void ratio of both control soils and twenty four stabilized soil samples. The result revealed that Soils A and B coefficient of volume and area compressibility, and compressibility index reached their lowest level at 7 and 10% stabilization which is good for engineering. The soils pre-consolidation pressure and coefficient of consolidation reached peak values at 7 and 10% bone ash stabilization. Therefore, addition of about 7 to 10% of bone ash to the soils will reduce their settlement potential and increase their stability.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

{"publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/dynamic-capabilities-of-smes-the-contributions-of-bricolage-and-s/", "title": "Dynamic Capabilities of SMEs: The Contributions of Bricolage and Social Capital", "year": "1997", "authors": ["Profiles"], "author_urls": ["https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/"], "abstract": "Objective: Dynamic capabilities are defined as “the firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments” (Teece et al., 1997, p. 516). In doing so they create value, derived from the capacity of a management team to identify opportunities and threats and reconfigure a firm’s repertoire of resources and operations to address them (Teece, 2007). While there is agreement that dynamic capabilities facilitate a firm’s competitiveness; there remains a lack of clarity around the notion and complexity surrounding the way in which they evolve (Eriksson, 2014). This, in particular, has created difficulties in identifying valid measurement tools to appraise their creation and deployment leading to the extant literature to rely upon qualitative, often longitudinal, case studies to analyse the phenonoma (Wang and Ahmed, 2007, Barreto, 2010, Eriksson, 2014). While previous research has investigated the dynamic capability concept in relation to its antecedent factors, the characteristics integral to their implementation, potential outcomes and influences upon competitive advantage and performance of firms (Zott, 2003, Song et al., 2005, Zuniga-Vicente and Vicente-Lorente, 2006, Wang et al., 2015). There is limited evidence available that examines the contribution made by the bricolage and social capital of management teams to the generation and use of dynamic capabilities. Literature review: It is suggested that the dynamic capabilities of SMEs originate from the often ad-hoc approaches to problem solving (Winter, 2003) and learning that results from the need to reconfigure resources and routines to address challenges (Prashantham and Floyd, 2012). This activity supports the development of soft assets - values, culture and experience – that underpin a firm’s dynamic capabilities and inform future learning processes adopted by management teams (Corner and Wu, 2012). The process, therefore, is associated with a firm’s resource-based changes, which include the improvement of existing capabilities and the development of new capabilities (Prashantham and Floyd, 2012). As indicated this is often ad hoc and achieved through trial-and-error and improvisation (Ahuja and Lampert, 2001, Miner et al., 2001), such learning has the effect of embedding capabilities into the DNA of a firm (Teece, 2007, Argote and Ren, 2012, Prashantham and Floyd, 2012). Changes in the dynamic capabilities of firms are the result of the learning that takes place within a management team during the process of improvisation and experimentation within the existing resource base (Hambrick and Mason, 1984, Martin, 2011, Kor and Mesko, 2013). It is argued that social capital is one mechanism for acquiring, assimilating and exploiting external knowledge and resource to transform a firm’s capability over time (Zahra and George, 2002, Le Breton-Miller and Miller, 2006, Prashantham and Young, 2011). Although Nemanich et al. (2010) have argued that social capital can overload and delay processes that create solutions; we propose that the social capital of a management team positively influences the development and appropriation of a firm’s dynamic capabilities. Bricolage helps create new from old and “something from nothing” (Baker and Nelson, 2005, p. 357) that lead to the strategic development of diverse, non-specialized resources (Gurca and Ravishankar, 2016). Those redifined resources at hand are appropriated through learning processes that are both improvisational (performative) and experimental (ostensive) (Weick, 1998, Baker, Miner and Eesley, 2003, Kreiser, 2011); and the outcomes are integrated into building dynamic capabilities. Method: This study is distinct from previous research as it employs a quantitative method and constructs a new multidimensional dynamic capability measurement by aggregating definitions, analysis and suggestions from previous literature to establish and test hypotheses (Teece, 2014). This measurement is validated by using the confirmatory factor analysis method before being utilized to examine a research framework. While early literature perceived social capital to be a unidimensional concept (Burt, 1992) this paper takes a more multidimensional perspective as posited by Adler and Kwon (2002), and employs a three-dimension approach, measuring relational, structural and cognitive social capital; first introduced by Nahapiet & Ghoshal (1998); and validated in later works (Karahanna and Preston, 2013, Huynh, 2016). To measure the bricolage of a management team, we employ a measurement constructed and validated by prior researchers (Davis et al., 2013, Senyard, Baker, Steffens and Davidsson, 2014). Hypotheses are tested and findings presented using data drawn from 274 SMEs in the UK. Structural equation modelling (SEM) is used to test the research hypotheses. This entails a two-stage approach; a measurement model using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine the validity and reliability of measurements, and a structural model to test the relationships among latent variables (Byrne, 2010). Findings: The results indicate support for all hypotheses; the social capital of management teams has a significant positive impact on the dynamic capabilities of SMEs. There is a significant positive link between the bricolage of management teams and the dynamic capabilities of SMEs and the social capital of management teams has a significant positive influence upon the bricolage of management teams. The results show that the mutual connections between social capital and bricolage, bricolage and dynamic capabilities, and social capital and dynamic capabilities are significantly positive. Values: This study addresses the gap in the literature and examines the influence that the social capital and bricolage of management teams have upon the the development of dynamic capabilities witin SMEs. We build on insights into the antecedents of dynamic capabilities in the context of resource-constrained firms through the deployment of bricolage and social capital, (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998, Baker and Nelson, 2005) and enhance this using fine-grained analyses to analyse how SMEs and their management teams learn through bricolage and each element of social capital contribute to the generation and appropriation of all three sub-sets of of dynamic capabilities; sensing, seizing and reconfiguring.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The fact that a positive relationship between engagement in learning across the lifetime and health outcomes exists is incontrovertible. Whilst it is acknowledged that our ability to learn declines slightly over the lifecourse this could be largely mitigated by suitably designed curriculum frameworks. There are notable benefits from engaging in the process of learning by way of keeping the brain active, socialising etc. and the outcomes of learning by gaining knowledge about, for example, new technologies, health behaviours etc. Through these mechanisms Life-Long Learning (LLL) serves as a channel to active and healthy ageing. \n\nHowever, what is interrogated in this paper is the quality of the evidence that we currently hold to provide a solid foundation to inform policy and practice. Many of the interventions reported in the academic literature make claims for best practice but evidence of replicability, validity and sustainability are weak. Significant issues such as the problems of defining ‘learning’ and ‘health’, methodological issues such as the ability to confirm causality and the influence of exogenous contingencies make it difficult to say with any confidence which LLL interventions would significantly address health equity. It is clear that those in the field of Later Life Learning would welcome a robust analysis of the data available in order to determine ‘what works’. Closer alliance between research and practice would benefit both the older learner and those tasked with allocating resources to enable LLL to be implemented across Europe. Only then might we be able to realise the full potential of LLL interventions as a tool to address health equity across Europe and beyond.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

This, in particular, has created difficulties in identifying valid measurement tools to appraise their creation and deployment leading to the extant literature to rely upon qualitative, often longitudinal, case studies to analyse the phenonoma (Wang and Ahmed, 2007, Barreto, 2010, Eriksson, 2014). There is, eventually, limited empirical evidence available that examines the influences of dynamic capabilities have on the competitive advantage and firms performance, specially, under the impact of gender diversity of management teams. Literature: Dynamic capabilities are defined as “the firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments” (Teece et al., 1997, p. 516). In doing so they create value, derived from the capacity of a management team to identify opportunities and threats and reconfigure a firm’s repertoire of resources and operations to address them (Teece, 2007). Upper Echelons theory has suggested that the decisions of management teams which significantly influences firms’ performance is consistent with the teams’ cognitive or executive orientations (Finkelstein and Hambrick 1996; Hambrick and Mason 1984). Such managerial approaches determine the ways in how management teams gather, filter and interpret information related to business environment, as well as how to response to environmental changes (Finkelstein and Hambrick 1996; Hambrick 2007). Extant literature has shown that the proportion of women in management teams changes such managerial activities, considered as key components of dynamic capabilities, which in turn positively influence firms’ performance. Approach: This study employs an internet-based survey to explore the dynamic capabilities of management teams, competitive advantage and performance of 274 SMEs in the UK. This study is distinct from previous research as it employs a quantitative method and constructs a new multidimensional dynamic capability measurement by aggregating definitions, analysis and suggestions from previous literature to establish and test hypotheses (Teece, 2014). This measurement is validated by using the confirmatory factor analysis method before being utilized to examine a research framework. To measure the competitive advantage and performance of SMEs, this study employs measurements adopted and validated by extant research (Pisano and Wheelwright, 1995; Hill and Jones, 2007; Wu, Wang, Tseng, and Wu, 2009; and Lumpkin and Dess, 2001). This study’s analysis entails a three-stage approach; a measurement model using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine the validity and reliability of measurements, a structural model to test the relationships among latent variables (Byrne, 2010), and a multigroup structural equation modelling to compare the male-dominant and non-male-dominant models. Findings: The results indicate support for hypotheses in which the dynamic capabilities of management teams has a significantly positive influence on competitive advantage, which in turn, enhances the performance of SMEs. The multigroup SEM analysis reveals that, within SMEs led by non-male-dominant teams, the dynamic capabilities have a significantly positive influence on firm’s performance, but this significantly link is not hold in the cases of SMEs led by male-dominant management teams. Values: This study examines the influence that the dynamic capabilities of management teams had upon the competitive advantage and performance of SMEs. We build on insights into the antecedents of dynamic capabilities in the context of gender diversity of management teams to addresses a fundamental: How the gender diversity of management teams changes the effects of dynamic capabilities had on SME’s competitive advantage and performance. The results from this study also helps to clarify a controversy over the relationship between dynamic capabilities and a firm’s performance.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Planetary gearboxes failure has been a major problem in systems reliability, hence condition monitoring of this component is essential. In order to identify faults, a dynamic model of the gearbox is presented taking into account backlash and tooth cracks. Newtonian equations of motion developed for a planetary gear is solved and modal analysis for solving the lumped parametric differential equations of modelled single stage planetary gearbox is adopted to observe the vibrational responses and to compare with existing literature. This work focuses primarily on the effects of stiffness and damping. The eigenvalue problem has been solved to measure the natural frequencies and amplitude of the system. Parametric studies using stiffness and damping results indicate significant changes in vibrational signals when there is a crack present on tooth. Simulation results also show the relation between increment in backlash and high frequency responses in the resultant vibration.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The measured Ferrite Number can decrease with an increase in cooling rate of the welding process, contradicting to what is mentioned in the literature. However, the Ferrite Number Density will increase with an increase in the cooling rate in an FA type of solidification, for low and moderate cooling rates, irrespective of the size of the weld bead. 2. FND is a better indicator of the ferrite content of the weld bead, especially when welding thin sheets. FND follows all the expected trends when compared to the literature, which the FN values don't. 3. The cut-off weld area under which the FND is superior to the FN value was found to be 13 mm2 when the aspect ratio is greater than 2.5. For welds with cross-sectional area larger than this value, FN can be directly used as an indicator of ferrite content, or alternatively, the measured FN must be divided by 13 mm2 instead of the actual cross-sectional area to obtain the FND so long as the minimum aspect ratio criteria of the weld is not violated. 4. For the TIG welding process producing fully penetrated weldments, the minimum cross-sectional area of welds done on 2.4 mm thick sheets was found to be 13.547 mm2, which is more than the FGAB1.3-Fe probe magnetic flux field. Consequently to simplify, the cut-off values for sheets having a thickness greater than 2.4 mm, the FN can be used as a direct indicator of the ferrite content of the weld. For sheets thinner than 0.9 mm with an aspect ratio greater than 2.5, the FND must be used as an indicator of the ferrite content in the weld. For sheet thicknesses in between 0.9 and 2.4, FN or FND may be used depending on the cross-sectional area of the weld and its aspect ratio.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

The ultimate goal is to propose a solution for to facilitate office workers' emotional recovery and wellbeing while in the workplace. More specifically, our study proposes a developmental concept of the ``Aerie'', a bespoke portable and collapsible structure that can be empirical tested in different workplace areas. Its modular design accommodates a range of interactive technologies aiming to improve and maintain personal wellbeing in workplace with minimal lose in working time or productivity. A preliminary literature review has provided some cues about features of an ideal regenerative space; drawing from this existing knowledge, we have developed a conceptual space to test participants' response to a combination of these features. The aim of this experiment was to evaluate which combination of features could calm individuals through a multi - sensory experience combined with a guided relaxation exercise. Findings from this pilot projects have provided an insight in the design of the ``Aerie''. Out of 38 participants, the majority reported that blue/purple lights and rain as white noise were very relaxing features. The mindfulness mediation audio was also well received. Most participants preferred to sit in a small cosy space (such as a corner or bean bags), rather than larger more exposed arrangements, for example chair or sitting-ball. Drawing from these findings, an initial prototype of Aerie was developed; this will be displayed at the Wellbeing conference to demonstrate the principle and verify its feasibility.

This is probably because of the severe adverse effects that contrary movements in these financial risks can have on the value of the firm or industry. Nevertheless, empirical studies on these risks have been very few and predominantly limited in scope. Therefore, using a sample of 402 UK non-financial firms from 31 industries, over the period January 1990 to December 2006, this study examines the relevance of these financial risks on the stock returns of firms and industries. Following the weaknesses of the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) methodology, the AR(1)EGARCH-M model was subsequently used for the estimation. The results indicated that the stock returns of UK industries were more affected by long-term interest rate risk than exchange rate risk (Trade weighted index, US$/£ JP¥/£) or even short-term interest rate risk. Additionally, by means of the Herfindahl index as a measure of industry concentration, competitive industries were found to exhibit a higher degree of exposure to movements in exchange rates and interest rates, and also higher volatility in returns than industries that were classified as concentrated. Finally, it was also found that for most UK industries: increased risk did not necessarily lead to an increase in returns; severe adverse movements in exchange rates and interest rates can potentially make returns more volatile; volatility of returns has time varying properties; and the persistence of volatility is much higher in some industries than others.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}

Once a week the bot goes shopping in the deep web where it randomly chooses and purchases one item and has it mailed directly to the exhibition space. Once the items arrive they are unpacked and displayed, each new object adding to a landscape of traded goods from the Darknet. \n\nThe Random Darknet Shopper is a live Mail Art piece, an exploration of the deep web via the goods traded there. It directly connects the Darknet with the gallery. By randomizing its consumerism, the bot is guaranteed a wide selection of goods from the thousands listed on deepweb markets. \n\nIn its first run from October 2014 - January 2015, Random Darknet Shopper bought 12 items from the deepweb market Agora, which were displayed at Kunst Halle St. Gallen in the exhibition «The Darknet - From Memes to Onionland. An Exploration». Since Agora discontinued its services in September, Random Darknet Shopper will now order items from Alpha Bay, currently the largest deepweb market place.", "organisations": ["CSM"]}
